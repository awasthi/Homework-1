  The main task of this group was to explore the tropical geometry arising
  from the tropicalization of character varieties of some finitely
  generated groups $\Gamma$ into $\SL_2\bbC$ and $\PSL_2\bbC$.%

  \pause%

  Using results we got from \texttt{Mathematica} and \texttt{GFan}, we
  conjectured that, at least in the case of free groups, the
  $\Trop(\frakX(F_n,\SL_2\bbC))=\Trop(\frakX(F_n,\PSL_2\bbC))$.%
