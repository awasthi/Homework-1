\begin{problem}
Let $(G,\cdot)$ be a group, $(H,+)$ be an Abelian group, and
$\varphi\colon G\to H$ be a group homomorphism. If $N$ is a subgroup such
that $\ker\varphi<N<G$, show that $N\lhd G$ is a normal subgroup.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
Let $N$ be a subgroup of $G$ containing $\ker\varphi$. Then we must show
that for any $g\in G$, $gNg^{-1}\subset N$. First we observe that, since
$\ker\varphi\lhd G$, then $\ker\varphi\lhd N$ since for any $g\in N$, $g$
is also in $G$ so that $g(\ker\varphi)g^{-1}=\ker\varphi\subset N$. Thus,
$\ker\varphi\lhd N$. By the first isomorphism theorem\footnote{Theorem 16
  of D.\,\& F.\,\S3, p.\,99.}, $G/\ker\varphi\cong H$ hence,
$G/\ker\varphi$ is Abelian. Moreover, $N/\ker\varphi<G/\ker\varphi$ hence,
$N/\ker\varphi\lhd G/\ker\varphi$. It follows immediately from the lattice
isomorphism theorem\footnote{Theorem 20 of D.\,\& F.\,\S3, p.\,99.} (this
is essentially the UMP of the quotient by a group) that $N\lhd G$.
\end{proof}
\begin{problem}
Let $(G,\cdot)$ be a finite Abelian group of even order, i.e., $|G|=2k$ for
some $k\in\bfN$.
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep,label=(\alph*)]
\item For $k$ odd, show that $G$ has exactly one element of order $2$.
\item Does the same happen for $k$ even? Prove or give a counterexample.
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
(a) This problem is most easily proven using Cauchy's
theorem\footnote{Theorem 11 of D.\,\& F.\,\S3, p.\,93}. Suppose $k$ is
odd. If $k=1$, $G\cong Z_2$ and we are done, since $Z_2$ contains only one
nontrivial element of order $2$. Suppose $k>1$ is odd. By Cauchy's theorem,
there exists an element $g\in G$ of order $2$. Seeking a contradiction,
suppose $h\in G$ is another element of order $2$. Then
