Let $(G,\cdot)$ be an Abelian group. The \emph{torsion subgroup of $G$} is
defined as the collection of elements of finite order:
\[
\Tor(G)\coloneqq

\]
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep,label=(\alph*)]
\item Show that the quotient group $G/{\Tor(G)}$ is \emph{torsion free},
  i.e., it contains no nontrivial elements of finite order.
