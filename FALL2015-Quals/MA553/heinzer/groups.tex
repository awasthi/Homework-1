\chapter{Heinzer MA 553 Problems}
Past Heinzer and WÅ‚odarczyk problems with proofs to the theorems,
corrolaries, and lemmas where I believe they would benefit me.
\section{Groups}
\begin{problem}
Does the symmetric group $S_5$ have a subgroup of order $10$? Justify your
answer.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
Yes. In fact, the following more general result holds
\begin{lemma}
The dihedral group on $n$ vertices, $D_{2n}$, imbeds into $S_n$, i.e.,
there exists an injective homomorphism $\varphi\colon D_{2n}\hookrightarrow
S_n$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}[Proof of lemma]
\renewcommand\qedsymbol{$\clubsuit$}
The group $D_{2n}$ acts transitively on the set $S\coloneqq\{1,...,n\}$ via the
action $\cdot\colon D_{2n}\times S\to S$
\[
x\cdot k\coloneqq
\begin{cases}
k+m &\text{if $x=r^m$}\\
n-k&\text{if $x=s$}.
\end{cases}
\]
\end{proof}
\end{proof}
