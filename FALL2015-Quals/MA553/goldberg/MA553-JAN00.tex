\begin{problem}
Let $R$ be a ring with identity $1$ and consider the following two
conditions:
\begin{center}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
\item If $a,b\in R$ and $ab=0$, then $ba=0$;
\item If $a,b\in R$ and $ab=1$, then $ba=1$;
\end{enumerate}
\end{center}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item Show that (i) implies (ii).
\item Show by example that (ii) does not imply (i).
\end{enumerate}

\begin{problem}
Let $F$ be a field. Suppose that $E/F$ is a Galois extension, and that
$L/F$ is an algebraic extension with $L\cap E=F$. Let $EL$ be the composite
field, i.e., the subfield of an algebraic closer $\bar F$ of $F$ generated
by $E$ and $L$.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item Show $EL/L$ is a Galois extension.
\item Show that there is an injective homomorphism
\[\varphi\colon\Gal(EL/L)\hookrightarrow\Gal(E/F).\]
Find the fixed field of the image of $\varphi$.
\item Show that $[EL:L]=[E:F]$.
\item Give an example to show that the conclusion of (c) is false if we do
  not assume that $E/F$ is Galois.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{problem}
Let $G$ be a finite group. Let $p$ be a prime and suppose that $|G|=p^km$,
with $k\geq 1$ and $p\nmid m$. Let $X$ be the collection of all subsets of
$G$ of order $p^k$. Then $G$ acts on $X$ by left multiplication, i.e.,
$g\cdot A=\left\{\,ga\;\middle|\;a\in A\,\right\}$. For $A\in X$< denote by
$H_A$ the stabilizer in $G$ of $A$. Show that $|H_A|\mid p^k$.

\begin{problem}
Let $R=\bfZ+X\bfQ[X]\subset\bfQ[X]$ be the ring consisting of polynomials
with rational coefficients whose constant term is an integer.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item Prove that $R$ is an integral domain, with units $1$ and $-1$.
\item Show that $x$ is not an irreducible element of $R$.
\item Let $(X)\coloneqq Rx$ be the ideal of $R$ generated by $X$. Describe
  $R/(X)$ and show that $R/(X)$ is not an integral domain. What can you
  conclude about $X$?
