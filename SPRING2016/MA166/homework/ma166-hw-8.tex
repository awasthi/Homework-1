\begin{problem}[Stewart \S{6.4}, Exercise 3]
  A variable force of $5x^{-2}$ pounds moves an object along a straight
  line when it is $x$ feet from the origin. Calculate the work done in
  moving the object from $x=1$ft to $x=10$ft.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}[Solution]
\end{proof}
\begin{problem}[Stewart  \S{6.4}, Exercise 5]
  Shown is the graph of a force function (in newtons) that increases to its
  maximum value and then remains constant. How much work is done by the
  force in moving an object a distance of $\SI{8}{\meter}$?
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}[Solution]
\end{proof}
\begin{problem}[Stewart \S{6.4}, Exercise 10]
  If the work required to stretch a spring $1$ ft beyond its natural length
  is $12$ ft-lb, how much work is needed to stretch it $9$ in beyond its
  natural length?
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}[Solution]
\end{proof}
\begin{problem}[Stewart \S{6.4}, Exercise 19]
  An aquarium $\SI{2}{\meter}$ long, $\SI{1}{\meter}$ wide, and
  $\SI{1}{\meter}$ deep is full of water. Find the work needed to pump half
  of the water out of the aquarium. (Use the fact that the density of water
  is $\SI{1000}{\kilo\gram\cdot\meter^{-3}}$.)
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}[Solution]
First we find the mass of the water in the rectangular aquarium.
\end{proof}
