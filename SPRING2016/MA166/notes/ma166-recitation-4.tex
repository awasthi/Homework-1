\begin{problem}[Fall 2015, \# 6]
The base of a solid is a circular disc in the $xy$-plane of radius
$1$. Its cross sections perpendicular to the $x$â€“axis are isosceles
right triangles, with hypotenuse in the base. Find the volume of this
solid.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}[Solution]
We need a few equations to set this problem up. First, we need to find the
base, height, and area of a right isosceles triangle. Since two of the
sides of the isosceles triangle are the same and the angle between them is
$\pi/2$, by the Pythagorean theorem we have
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:base-height-of-isosceles}
b^2+h^2=b^2+b^2=2b^2={h'}^2
\end{equation}
where $b$ is the base, $h$ is the height (which in this case is equal to
the base $b$), and $h'$ is the hypotenuse. Then $b=h=h'/\sqrt{2}$. Hence,
the area of the triangle is
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:area-of-isosceles-triangle}
\tfrac{1}{2}bh=\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{{h'}^2}{2}\right)=\tfrac{1}{4}{h'}^2.
\end{equation}
Exploiting the geometry of the base, let us consider the right \ul{half}
of the circular base, find the area, and double our result to get the total
area. Now, how does the hypotenuse change of the isosceles triangle
changes as we move from left to right on the interval $0\leq x\leq 1$. At
$x=0$, the base of the hypotenuse will be $2$. If we move a little to the
right $x$, the hypotenuse will be given by the equation
\[
{h'}=2\sqrt{1-x^2}.
\]
Then, plugging in this value into our equation for the area (Equation
(\ref{eq:area-of-isosceles-triangle})) we have
\[
\tfrac{1}{4}{h'}^2=\tfrac{1}{4}\left(2\sqrt{1-x^2}\right)^2=1-x^2.
\]
Now, approximating the volume by the Riemann sum and taking the limit, we
get the volume over $0\leq x\leq 1$
\[
\int_0^1 1-x^2\diff x=\left.x-\tfrac{1}{3}x^3\right|_0^1=1-\frac{1}{3}=\frac{2}{3}.
\]
Last but not least, let us double the volume to get a total of
\[
V=2\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)=\boxed{\frac{4}{3}.}
\]
\end{proof}
