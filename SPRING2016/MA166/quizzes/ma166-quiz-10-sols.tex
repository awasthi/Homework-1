\begin{proof}[Solution to Problem 1]
This series is convergent by the alternating series test. Set $a_n\coloneqq
n^{-1/3}$. Note that $1/a_n=n^{1/3}<(n+1)^{1/3}=1/na_{n+1}$ so $a_{n+1}\leq
a_n$ and (ii) $\lim_{n\to\infty} a_n=0$. Hence, the series converges.
\end{proof}
\bigskip
\begin{proof}[Solution to Problem 2]
Set $a_n\coloneqq (n+1)!/3^n$ and use the ratio test. By the ratio test, we
have
\[
\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}=\frac{(n+2)!/3^{n+1}}{(n+1)!/3^{n}}=\frac{(n+2)(n+1)!}{3(n+1)!}=\frac{n+2}{3}
\]
which goes to $\infty$ as $n\to\infty$ so the ratio tests says that the
series is divergent.
\end{proof}
