\begin{problem}
Let $G$ be a finite group, $p$ a prime number, $N$ the intersection of all
$p$-Sylow subgroups of $G$. Show that $N$ is a normal $p$-subgroup of $G$
and that every normal $p$-subgroup of $G$ is contained in $N$.

\begin{problem}
Let $G=\left\{e,a_1,a_2,a_3\right\}$ be a non-cyclic group of order $4$ and
define $\varphi\colon S_3\to\Aut(G)$ by $\varphi(\sigma)(e)=e$ and
$\varphi(\sigma)(a_1)=a_{\sigma(i)}$. Show that $\varphi$ is well-defined and an
isomorphism of groups.
