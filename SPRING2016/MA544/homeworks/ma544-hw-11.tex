\begin{problem}[Wheeden \& Zygmund {\S}7, Ex.\@ 11]
Prove the following result concerning changes of variable. Let $g(t)$ be
monotone increasing and absolutely continuous on $[\alpha,\beta]$ and let $f$
be integrable on $[a,b]$, $a= g(\alpha)$, $b=
g(\beta)$. Then $f(g(t))g'(t)$ is measurable and integrable on
$[\alpha,\beta]$, and
\[
\int_a^b f(x)d x=\int_\alpha^\beta f(g(t))g'(t)d t.
\]
(Consider the case when $f$ is the characteristic function of an interval,
an open set, etc.)
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
Recall that, by Theorem 5.21, $f$ is integrable (or in $L^1$) on
$[\alpha,\beta]$ if and only if $|f|$ is integrable on
$[\alpha,\beta]$. Therefore, it suffices to prove the result for the case
$f\geq 0$. We split the proof of the result into a series of claims and
then proceed to show the more general result.
\begin{claim}
Let $g$ be as above and $G$ be an open subset of $[\alpha,\beta]$. Then
\[
|g(G)|=\int_G g'(t)dt.
\]
\end{claim}
\begin{proof}[Proof of claim 1]
\renewcommand\qedsymbol{$\clubsuit$}
Let $G$ be an open subset of $(a,b)$ then, by Theorem 1.10, $G$ can be
written as the countable union of disjoint open intervals $\{I_k\}$. By
Theorem 5.7, since $g'$ is nonnegative and measurable and
$\int_Gg'$ is finite (in particular, it is bounded above by $\int_a^bg'$),
we have
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:11:additive-measure}
\int_Gg'(t)dt=\sum_k\int_{I_k}g'(t)dt.
\end{equation}
But by Theorem 7.27, since $g$ is absolutely continuous on
$[\alpha,\beta]$, $g$ is b.v.\@ on $[\alpha,\beta]$ so by Theorem 7.30
\[
|g(I_k)|
=g(\beta_k)-g(\alpha_k)
=V[g;\alpha_k,\beta_k]
=\int_{\alpha_k}^{\beta_k}g'(t)dt
\]
where $\alpha_k$ is the left-most endpoint of $I_k$ and $\beta_k$ the
right-most. By Equation \eqref{eq:11:additive-measure}, on the right-hand
side, we have
\[
\int_{I_k}g'(t)dt=|g(I_k)|
\]
so, by Theorem 3.23, we have
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:11:measure-sum-integral-dev}
\int_G g'(t)dt
=\sum_k|g(I_k)|
=\left|g\left({\textstyle\bigcup_k I_k}\right)\right|
=|g(G)|
\end{equation}
as desired.
\end{proof}
\begin{claim}
Let $g$ be as above and $E$ be a $G_\delta$-subset of
$[\alpha,\beta]$. Then
\[
|g(E)|=\int_E g'(t)dt.
\]
\end{claim}
\begin{proof}[Proof of claim 2]
\renewcommand\qedsymbol{$\clubsuit$}
Suppose $E$ is a $G_\delta$-set then, $E$ is the countable intersection of
open subsets $G_k$ of $[\alpha,\beta]$.
\end{proof}
\end{proof}

Theorem 7.43 shows that a convex function is the indefinite integral of a
monotone increasing function. Prove the converse: If
$\varphi(x)=\int_a^xf(t)dt+\varphi(a)$ in $(a,b)$ and $f$ is monotone
increasing, then $\varphi$ is convex in $(a,b)$. (Use Exercise 14.)

Prove (5.49).
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
Recall the content of equation 5.49: For $f$ measurable, we have
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:11:chebyshevs-inequality}
\omega(\alpha)\leq\frac{1}{\alpha^p}\int\limits_{\{\,f>\alpha\,\}}f^p,\quad\alpha>0.
\end{equation}

If $f\geq 0$, show that $f\in L^p$ if and only if $\sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty
