\begin{problem}[Wheeden \& Zygmund {\S}4, Ex.\@ 4]
Let $f$ be defined and measurable in $\bfR^n$. If $T$ is a nonsingular
linear transformation of $\bfR^n$, show that $f(T\bfx)$ is measurable. [If
$E_1=\left\{\,\bfx\;\middle|\; f(\bfx)>a\,\right\}$ and
$E_2=\left\{\,\bfx\;\middle|\;f(T\bfx)>a\,\right\}$.]

\begin{problem}[Wheeden \& Zygmund {\S}4, Ex.\@ 7]
Let $f$ be usc and less that $+\infty$ on a compact set $E$. Show that $f$
is bounded above on $E$. Show also that $f$ assumes its maximum on $E$,
i.e., that there exists $\bfx_0\in E$ such that $f(\bfx_0)\geq f(\bfx)$ for
all $\bfx\in E$.

\begin{problem}[Wheeden \& Zygmund {\S}4, Ex.\@ 8]
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item Let $f$ and $g$ be two functions which are usc at $\bfx_0$. Show that
  $f+g$ is usc at $\bfx_0$. If $f-g$ usc at $\bfx_0$? When is $fg$ usc at
  $\bfx_0$?
\item If $\left\{f_k\right\}$ is a sequence of functions are usc at
  $\bfx_0$, show that $\inf f_k(\bfx)$ is usc at $\bfx_0$.
\item If $\left\{f_k\right\}$ is a sequence of functions which are usc at
  $\bfx_0$ and which converge uniformly near $\bfx_0$, show that $\lim f_k$
  is usc at $\bfx_0$.
