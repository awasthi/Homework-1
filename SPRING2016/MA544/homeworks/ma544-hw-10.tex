\begin{problem}[Wheeden \& Zygmund {\S}7, Ex.\@ 1]
Let $f$ be measurable in $\bfR^n$ and different from zero in some set of
positive measure. Show that there is a positive constant $c$ such that
$f^*(\bfx)\geq c\|\bfx\|^{-n}$ for $\|\bfx\|\geq 1$.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
Let $E$ be a measurable subset of $\bfR^n$ with positive measure such that
$f(\bfx)\neq 0$ for all $\bfx\in E$. Moreover, for now, assume that
$|E|<\infty$. By Vitali's lemma, for ${\{Q_k\}}_{k=1}^N$ a finite cover of
$E$ by cubes, there exists a real number $\beta>0$ such that
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:hw-10-vitalis-bound}
|E|<\frac{1}{\beta}\sum_{k=1}^N|Q_k|.
\end{equation}
Let $\chi_k$ be the characteristic function of $Q_k$, then, by Lebesgue's
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}[Wheeden \& Zygmund {\S}7, Ex.\@ 2]
Let $\varphi(\bfx),\bfx\in\bfR^n$, be a bounded measurable function such
that $\varphi(\bfx)=0$ for $\|\bfx\|\geq 1$ and $\int\varphi=1$. For
$\varepsilon>0$, let
$\varphi_\varepsilon(\bfx)\coloneqq\varepsilon^{-n}\varphi(\bfx/\varepsilon)$. ($\varphi_\varepsilon$
is called an \emph{approximation to the identity}.) If $f\in L^1(\bfR^n)$,
show that
\[
\lim_{\varepsilon\to 0}(f*\varphi_\varepsilon)(x)=f(\bfx)
\]
in the Lebesgue set of $f$. (Note that $\int\varphi_\varepsilon=1$,
$\varepsilon>0$, so that
\[
(f*\varphi_\varepsilon)(\bfx)-f(\bfx)=\int\left[f(\bfx-\bfy)-f(\bfx)\right]\varphi_\varepsilon(\bfy)d\bfy.
\]
Use Theorem 7.16.)

Show that if $\alpha>0$, then $x^\alpha$ is absolutely continuous on every
bounded subinterval of $[0,\infty)$.

\begin{problem}[Wheeden \& Zygmund {\S}7, Ex.\@ 8]
Prove the following converse of Theorem 7.31: If $f$ is of bounded
variation on $[a,b]$, and if the function $V(x)=V[a,x]$ is absolutely
continuous on $[a,b]$, then $f$ is absolutely continuous on $[a,b]$.

\begin{problem}[Wheeden \& Zygmund {\S}7, Ex.\@ 9]
If $f$ is of bounded variation on $[a,b]$, show that
\[
\int_a^b|f'|\leq V[a,b].
\]
Show that if equality holds in this inequality, then $f$ is absolutely
continuous on $[a,b]$. (For the second part, use Theorems 2.2(ii) and 7.24
to show that $V(x)$ is absolutely continuous and then use the result of
Exercise 8).

\begin{problem}[Wheeden \& Zygmund {\S}7, Ex.\@ 11]
Prove the following result concerning changes of variable. Let $g(t)$ be
monotone increasing and absolutely continuous on $[\alpha,\beta]$ and let $f$
be integrable on $[a,b]$, $a\coloneqq g(\alpha)$, $b\coloneqq
g(\beta)$. Then $f(g(t))g'(t)$ is measurable and integrable on
$[\alpha,\beta]$, and
\[
\int_a^b f(x)d x=\int_\alpha^\beta f(g(t))g'(t)d t.
\]
(Consider the case when $f$ is the characteristic function of an interval,
an open set, etc.)
