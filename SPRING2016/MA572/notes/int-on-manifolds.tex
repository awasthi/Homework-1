\chapter{Integration on Manifolds (de Rham Cohomolgy)}
Let's talk a little about de Rham cohomology here, since I like it so
much. The references are the first chapter of \emph{Differential Forms in
  Algebraic Topology} by Bott and Tu.
\section{De Rham Theory}
\subsection{The de Rham Complex on $\bbR^n$}
To start things off in this section we define the de Rham cohomology and
compute a few examples. This will turn out to be the most important
diffeomorphism invariant of a manifold. So let $x_1,\dotsc,x_n$ be linear
coordinates on $\bbR^n$.
