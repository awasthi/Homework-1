\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item Compute the homology groups $H_n(X,A)$ when $X$ is $S^2$ or
  $S^1\times S^1$ and $A$ is a finite set of points in $X$.
\item Compute the groups $H_n(X,A)$ and $H_n(X,B)$ for $X$ a closed
  orientable surface of genus two with $A$ and $B$ the circles shown. [What
  are $X/A$ and $X/B$?]

Prove the Brouwer fixed point theorem for maps $f\colon D^n\to D^n$ by applying
degree theory to the map $S^n\to S^n$ that sends both the northern and
southern hemispheres of $S^n$ to the southern hemisphere via $f$. [This was
Brouwerâ€™s original proof.]
