Show that $\widetilde H_n(X)\cong\widetilde H_{n+1}(SX)$ for all $n$, where
$SX$ is the suspension of $X$. More generally, thinking of $SX$ as the
union of two cones $CX$ with their bases identified, compute the reduced
homology groups of the union of the union of any finite number of cones
$CX$ with their bases identified.

Prove by induction on the dimension the following facts about the homology
of a finite dimensional CW complex $X$, using the observation that
$X^n/X^{n-1}$ is a wedge sum of $n$-spheres:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item If $X$ has dimension $n$ then $H_i(X)=0$ for $i>n$ and $H_n(X)$ is
  free.
\item $H_n(X)$ is free with basis in bijective correspondence with the
  $n$-cells if there are no cells of dimension $n-1$ or $n+1$.
\item If $X$ is has $k$ $n$-cells, then $H_n(X)$ is generated by at most
  $k$ elements.
\end{enumerate}

Given a map $f\colon S^{2n}\to S^{2n}$, show that there is some point $x\in
S^{2n}$ with either $f(x)=x$ or $f(x)=-x$. Deduce that every map
$\bfRP^{2n}\to\bfRP^{2n}$ has a fixed point. Construct maps
$\bfRP^{2n-1}\to\bfRP^{2n-1}$ without fixed points from linear
transformations $\bfR^{2n}\to\bfR^{2n}$ without eigenvectors.
