Let $f\colon S^n\to S^n$ be a map of degree zero. Show that there exists
points $x,y\in S^n$ with $f(x)=x$ and $f(y)=-y$. Use this to show that if
$F$ is a continuous vector field defined on the unit ball $D^n$ in $\bfR^n$
such that $F(x)\neq 0$ for all $x$, then there exists a point on $\partial
D$ where $F$ points radially outward and another point on $\partial D^n$
where  $F$ points radially inward.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
Since $\deg f=0\neq (-1)^n=\deg a$, then $f\nsimeq a$ and so must have a
fixed point $x\in S^n$. Now, consider the map $g\coloneqq a\circ f$. Since
$\deg g=\deg a\circ f=(\deg a)(\deg f)=0$, $g$ must have a fixed point
$y\in S^n$. Since $g(y)=a\circ f(y)=y$, then $f(y)=-y$.

Suppose $F$ is a continuous nonzero vector field on $S^n$, i.e., a map
$S^n\to\bfR^n$ which assigns to each point $x\in S^n$ a tangent vector
$\bfv(x)$ at $x$. Then, the map $f\colon\partial D^n\to\bfR^n$ given by
$f(\bfv(x))=\bfv(x)/\|\bfv(x)\|$ is well defined and nowhere zero.

For an invertible linear transformation $f\colon\bfR^n\to\bfR^n$ show that
the induced map
$H_n\left(\bfR^n,\bfR^n\minus\{\mathbf{0}\}\right)\cong\widetilde
H_{n-1}\left(\bfR^n\minus\{\mathbf{0}\}\right)\cong\bfZ$ is $\id$ or $-\id$
according to whether the determinant of $f$ is positive or negative. [Use
Gaußian elimination to show that the matrix of $f$ can be joined by a path
of invertible matrices to a diagonal matrix with $\pm 1$'s on the
diagonal.]
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
We show that $\Orth_n(\bfR)$ is a deformation retraction of $\GL_n(\bfR)$
and prove the result there. This procedure is adapted from a hint in
\emph{\textru{Элементарная топология}} by \textru{Виро и др.} BY

Let $X$ be the $2$-complex obtained from $S^1$ with its usual cell
structure by attaching two $2$-cells by maps of degrees $2$ and $3$,
respectively.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item Compute the homology groups of all the subcomplexes $A\subset X$ and
  the corresponding quotient complexes $X/A$.
\item Show that $X\simeq S^2$ and that the only subcomplex $A\subset X$ for
  which the quotient map $X\to X/A$ is a homotopy equivalence is the
  trivial subcomplex, the $0$-cell.
