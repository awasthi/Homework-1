Let $f\colon S^n\to S^n$ be a map of degree zero. Show that there exists
points $x,y\in S^n$ with $f(x)=x$ and $f(y)=-y$. Use this to show that if
$F$ is a continuous vector field defined on the unit ball $D^n$ in $\bfR^n$
such that $F(x)\neq 0$ for all $x$, then there exists a point on $\partial
D$ where $F$ points radially outward and another point on $\partial D^n$
where  $F$ points radially inward.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
Since $\deg f=0\neq (-1)^n=\deg a$, then $f\nsimeq a$ and so must have a
fixed point $x\in S^n$. Now, consider the map $g\coloneqq a\circ f$. Since
$\deg g=\deg a\circ f=(\deg a)(\deg f)=0$, $g$ must have a fixed point
$y\in S^n$. Since $g(y)=a\circ f(y)=y$, then $f(y)=-y$.

Suppose $F$ is a continuous nonzero vector field on $S^n$, i.e., a map
$S^n\to\bfR^n$ which assigns to each point $x\in S^n$ a tangent vector
$\bfv(x)$ at $x$. Then, the map $f\colon\partial D^n\to\bfR^n$ given by
$f(\bfv(x))=\bfv(x)/\|\bfv(x)\|$ is well defined and nowhere zero.

For an invertible linear transformation $f\colon\bfR^n\to\bfR^n$ show that
the induced map
$H_n\left(\bfR^n,\bfR^n\minus\{\mathbf{0}\}\right)\cong\widetilde
H_{n-1}\left(\bfR^n\minus\{\mathbf{0}\}\right)\cong\bfZ$ is $\id$ or $-\id$
according to whether the determinant of $f$ is positive or negative. [Use
Gaußian elimination to show that the matrix of $f$ can be joined by a path
of invertible matrices to a diagonal matrix with $\pm 1$'s on the
diagonal.]
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
We show that $\Orth_n(\bfR)$ is a deformation retraction of $\GL_n(\bfR)$
and prove the result there. This procedure is adapted from a hint in
\emph{\textru{Элементарная топология}} by \textru{Виро, Нецветаев и
  Харламов, стр.\@ 338, номер 39.11.} Suppose $f\colon\bfR^n\to\bfR^n$ is
an invertible linear transformation. Let
$\left\{\mathbf{f}_1,...,\mathbf{f}_n\right\}$ be the set of columns
vectors of the matrix representation $F$ of $f$. By Gram--Schmidt
orthogonalization construct the vectors
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:gram-schmidt-orth}
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{e}_1&\coloneqq\lambda_{11}\mathbf{f}_1\\
\mathbf{e}_2&\coloneqq\lambda_{21}\mathbf{f}_1+\lambda_{22}\mathbf{f}_2\\
&\vdotswithin{{}\coloneqq{}}\\
\mathbf{e}_n&\coloneqq\lambda_{n1}\mathbf{f}_1+\cdots+\lambda_{nn}\mathbf{f}_n
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where the $\lambda_{kk}>0$ for $k=1,...,n$. Now set
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:vectors-as-function-of-t}
\mathbf{g}_k(t)\coloneqq
t\left(\lambda_{n1}\mathbf{f}_1+\lambda_{n2}\mathbf{f}_2+\cdots+\lambda_{kk-1}\mathbf{f}_{k-1}\right)+(t\lambda_{kk}+1-t)\mathbf{f}_k.
\end{equation}
Let $g(t,A)$ be the matrix whose columns are the vectors $\mathbf{g}_k(t)$
and define a homotopy $f_t\colon I\times\GL_n(\bfR)\to\GL_n(\bfR)$ by mapping
the pair $(t,A)\mapsto g(t,A)$. Continuity of $H$ follows from the fact
that $H$ it is multiplication in $\bfR^n$ followed by a linear
mapping. It's not hard to see that $f_t$ stays in $\GL_n(\bfR)$ for all $t$
and $f_1(A)$ is in $\Orth_n(\bfR)$.

Last but not least, we show that $\Orth_n(\bfR)$ consists of two connected
components and that membership of $f$ to one of these components is
determined by $\det f$. First note that
$\det\left(\Orth_n(\bfR)\right)=\{-1,1\}$ which is disconnected in
$\bfR$. Hence, $\Orth_n(\bfR)$ is disconnected. Now, if
$f\in\Orth_n(\bfR)$, either $\det f=1$ or $\det f=-1$. Without loss of
generality, we may assume $\det f=1$ since if $r$ is a reflection. Consider
the map $k \colon I\times \Orth_n(\bfR)\to\Orth_n(\bfR)$ given by
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:homotopy-det-1}
k(t,A)\coloneqq e^{At}
\end{equation}

Let $X$ be the $2$-complex obtained from $S^1$ with its usual cell
structure by attaching two $2$-cells by maps of degrees $2$ and $3$,
respectively.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]

  the corresponding quotient complexes $X/A$.
