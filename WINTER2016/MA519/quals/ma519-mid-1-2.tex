The author of this document apologizes for any ungrammatical content in
this document. We present the problems as they are given to us and only
correct grammar and orthography when it is obvious what the author meant.
\begin{problem}
  Suppose \(n\) balls are distributed at random into \(r\) boxes in such a
  way that each ball chooses a box independently of each other. Let \(S\)
  be the number of \emph{empty boxes}. Compute \(E(S)\) and \(\Var(S)\).

  \noindent\emph{Hint:} Consider the random variables \(X_k\), for
  \(k=1,\dotsc,r\), which equals \(1\) if the \(k\)\textsup{th} box is
  empty and \(0\) otherwise. Relate \(S\) and the \(X_k\).
\end{problem}
\begin{solution*}
  Write \(S=\sum_{k=1}^n X_k\) where \(X_k\) is \(1\) if the
  \(k\)\textsup{th} box is empty and \(0\) otherwise. Then the expected
  value of \(S\) is
  \begin{align*}
    E(S)
    &=E\left(\sum\nolimits_{k=1}^r X_k\right)\\
    &=\sum_{k=1}^n E(X_k)\\
    &=r E(X_1).
  \end{align*}
  Before finding a closed form for \(E(S)\) we need to compute
  \(E(X_1)\). Unraveling the definition, we have
  \[
    E(X_1)=0\cdot P(X_1=0)+1\cdot P(X_1=1)=P(X_1=1).
  \]
  Lastly,
  \[
    P(X_1=1)=\frac{(r-1)^n}{r^n}=\left(1-\tfrac{1}{r}\right)^n.
  \]
  Thus,
  \[
    E(S)=r\left(1-\tfrac{1}{r}\right)^n.
  \]

  As for the variance, the second moment can likewise be computed as
  \begin{align*}
    E(S^2)
    &=E\left[\left(\sum\nolimits_{k=1}^r X_k\right)^2\right]\\
    &=E\left(\sum\nolimits_{k=1}^r X_k^2\right)
      +E\left(\sum\nolimits_{j\neq k}^r X_jX_k\right)\\
    &=\sum_{k=1}^r E(X_k^2)+\sum_{j\neq k} E(X_jX_k)\\
    &=\sum_{k=1}^r E(X_k)+\sum_{j\neq k}E(X_jX_k)\\
    &=r\left(1-\tfrac{1}{r}\right)^n+\sum_{j\neq k}E(X_jX_k).
  \end{align*}
  Now, the sum
  \[
    \sum_{j\neq k}E(X_jX_k)=%
    \sum_{j\neq k}P(X_j=1,X_k=1)=\sum_{j\neq
      k}\left(1-\tfrac{2}{r}\right)^n=%
    \tbinom{r}{2}\left(1-\tfrac{2}{r}\right)^n.
  \]
  Thus,
  \[
    \Var(S)=%
    r\left(1-\tfrac{1}{r}\right)^n+%
    \tbinom{r}{2}\left(1-\tfrac{2}{r}\right)^n-%
    r^2\left(1-\tfrac{1}{r}\right)^{2n}.\qedhere

\begin{problem}
  Suppose \(n\) balls are distributed in \(n\) boxes in such a way that
  each ball chooses a box independently of each other.
  \begin{alphlist}
  \item What is the probability that box \# 1 is empty?
  \item What is the probability that only box \# 1 is empty?
  \item What is the probability that only one box is empty?
  \item Given that box \# 1 is empty, what is the probability that only one
    box is empty?
  \item Given that only one box is empty, what is the probability that box
    \# 1 is empty?
  \end{alphlist}

  \noindent\emph{Hint:} make use of the fact that the number of balls and
  boxes are the same.
\end{problem}
\begin{solution*}
  For part (a), the probability that box \# 1 is empty can be quickly shown
  to be
  \[
    \left(1-\tfrac{1}{n}\right)^n;
  \]
  i.e., there are \(n^n\) ways to distribute the \(n\) balls among the
  \(n\) boxes; then there are \((n-1)^n\) ways to distribute the \(n\)
  balls among the \(n-1\) remaining boxes.
  \\\\
  For part (b), the probability that only box \# 1 is empty is
  \[
    \frac{\binom{n}{2}(n-1)!}{n^n};
  \]
  i.e., each box must contain at least \(1\) ball and there are
  \(\binom{n}{2}(n-1)!\) ways to distribute \(2\) of the \(n\) balls among
  the remaining \(n-1\) boxes.
  \\\\
  For part (c), using part (b), the probability that exactly one box is
  empty is
  \[
    \frac{n\binom{n}{2}(n-1)!}{n^n};
  \]
  i.e., there are \(\binom{n}{1}=n\) ways to choose a box to be empty once
  this is done, the probability that said box is empty is the same as the
  probability that box \# 1 is empty; and that probability we found in part
  (b).

  For part (d),

  For part (e),

\begin{problem}
  McDonald's newest promotion is putting a toy inside every one of its
  hamburgers. Suppose there are \(N\) distinct types of toys and each of
  them is equally likely to be put inside any of the hamburges. What is the
  expected value and variance of the number of hamburgers you need to order
  (or eat) before you have a complet set of the \(N\) toys.

  \noindent\emph{Hint:} consider the number of hamburgers you need to order
  (or eat) in between getting one and two distinct types of toys, two and
  three distinct types of toys, and so forth.
\end{problem}
\begin{solution*}
  Here's a question: What is the probability that you will eat at least
  \(1\) of the \(N\) toys given that the toys are in the hamburger?
  WackDonald's is crazy for thinking it is a good idea to put their toys
  inside every one of their hamburgers.
\end{solution*}

\begin{problem}
  Let \(X\) and \(Y\) be two independent geometric random variables with
  parameter \(p\).
  \begin{alphlist}
  \item Find the probability distribution function of \(\min\{X,Y\}\).
  \item Find the probability distribution function of \(\max\{X,Y\}\).
  \item Find the probability distribution function of \(X+Y\).
  \item Find \(P(X=j\mid X+Y=k)\) for \(j=1,\dotsc,k-1\).
  \end{alphlist}
\end{problem}

\end{solution*}

\begin{problem}
  Suppose the events \(E\), \(F\), \(G\) are independent, in other words
  \begin{align*}
    P(E\cap F)&=P(E)P(F),\\
    P(F\cap G)&=P(F)P(G),\\
    P(G\cap E)&=P(G)P(E),\\
    P(E\cap F\cap G)&=P(E)P(F)P(G).
  \end{align*}
  Using he above definition, show that the following events are
  independent:
  \begin{alphlist}
  \item \(E\) and \(F^\rmc\);
  \item \(E\) and \(F\cap G^\rmc\);
  \item \(E\) and \(F^\rmc\cap G^\rmc\);
  \item \(E\) and \(F\cup G\);
  \item \(E\) and \(F\cup G^\rmc\).
  \end{alphlist}
