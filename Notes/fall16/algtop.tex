\chapter{Algebraic Topology}
From my meetings with Mark. We reference Hatcher's \emph{Algebraic
  Topology} \cite{hatcher} freely available here

\section{Cohomology}
Let's look at some examples to get an idea of what cohomolgy is all
about. Take the simplest case: Let \(X\) be a \(1\)-dimensional
\(\Delta\)-complex, i.e., an oriented graph. For a fixed abelian group
\(G\), the set of all functions from vertices of \(X\) to \(G\) forms an
abelian group
