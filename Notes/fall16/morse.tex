\section{Introduction}
In this section we will illustrate by a specific example the situation that
we will investigate later for arbitrary manifolds. Let us consider a torus
\(M\), tangent to the plane \(V\), as indicated in the diagram (that I will
not bother making ... yet)

Let \(f\colon M\to\bbR\) be the height above the \(V\) plane, and let
\(M^a\) be the set of all points \(x\in M\) such that \(f(x)\leq a\). Then
the following things are true:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*),noitemsep]
\item If \(a<0=f(p)\), then \(M^a\) is vacuous.
\item If \(f(p)<a<f(q)\), then \(M^a\) is homeomorphic to a \(2\)-cell.
\item If \(f(q)<a<f(r)\), then \(M^a\) is homeomorphic to a cylinder.
\item If \(f(r)<a<f(s)\), then \(M^a\) is homeomorphic to a compact
  manifold of genus one having a circle as a boundary.
\item If \(f(s)<a\), then \(M^a\) is a full torus.
\end{enumerate}

In order to describe the change in \(M^a\) as it passes through one of the
points \(f(p)\), \(f(q)\), \(f(r)\), \(fs\) it is convenient to consider
homotopy rather than homeomorphism type. In terms of homotopy types: (1)
\(\to\) (2) is the operation of attaching a \(0\)-cell. For as far as
homotopy type is concerned, the space \(M^a\), \(f(p)<a<f(q)\), cannot be
distinguished from a \(0\)-cell.

Here \(\approx\) means ``is of the same homotopy type as.''

(2) \(\to\) (3) is the operation of attaching a \(1\)-cell.

(3) \(\to\) (4) is again the operation of attaching a \(1\)-cell.

(4) \(\to\) (5) is the operation of attaching a \(2\)-cell.

The precise definition of ``attaching a \(k\)-cell'' can be given as
follows. Let \(Y\) be any topological space, and let
\[
  \bbD^k=\bigl\{\,x\in\bbR^k: |x|\leq 1\,\bigr\}
\]
be the \(k\)-cell consisting of all vectors in Euclidean \(k\)-space with
length less than or equal to \(1\). The boundary
\[
  \partial \bbD^k=\bigl\{\,x\in\bbR^k:|x|=1\,\bigr\}
\]
will be denoted by \(\bbS^{k-1}\). If \(g\colon \bbS^{k-1}\to Y\) is a continuous
map then
\[
  Y\sqcup_g \bbD^k
\]
(\(Y\) with a \(k\)-cell attached by \(g\)) is obtained by first taking the
topological sum (i.e., disjoint union) of \(Y\) and \(\bbD^k\), and
identifying each \(x\in \bbS^{k-1}\) with \(g(x)\in Y\). To take care of
the case \(k=0\) let \(\bbD^0\) be a point and let
\(\partial\bbD^0=S^{-1}\) be vacuous, so that \(Y\) is a \(0\)-cell
attached to just the union of \(Y\) and a disjoint point.

As one might expect, the point \(p\), \(q\), \(r\), and \(s\) at which the
homotopy type of \(M^a\) changes, have as simple characterization in terms
of \(f\). They are the critical points of the function. If we choose any
coordinate system \((x,y)\) near these points, then the derivatives
\(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\) and \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\) are
both zero. At \(p\) we can choose \((x,y)\) so that \(f=x^2+y^2\), at
\(s\) so that \(f=C-x^2-y^2\), and at \(q\) and \(r\) so that
\(f=C+x^2-y^2\). Note that the number of minus signs in the expression for
\(f\) at eeach point is the dimension of the cell we must attach to go from
\(M^a\) to \(M^b\), where \(a<f(*)<b\). Our first theorems will generalizet
hese facts for any differentiable function on a manifold.
