\chapter{Algebraic Geometry}
A summary to a course on an introduction to sheaf cohomology. We will
mostly reference Donu's notes available here
\url{https://www.math.purdue.edu/~dvb/classroom.html}, but also cite Ravi
Vakil's \emph{Fundamentals of Algebraic Geometry} \cite{vakil} available
here \url{https://math216.wordpress.com/}.

\section{The de Rham Complex}
Donu began his first lecture by talking about the de Rham complex and de
Rham cohomology so let us also begin by on his lecture. For this section,
we cite the first chapter of Bott and Tu's \emph{Differential Forms in
  Algebraic Topology} \cite{bott-tu}. Then, the integral
\[
  \iiint_{\partial\Omega} Fd S
\]
