\section{Differentiable manifolds}
\begin{definition}
  A \emph{differentiable manifold} of dimension \(n\) is a set \(M\) and a
  family of injective mappings
  \(\bfx_\alpha\colon U_\alpha\subset\bbR^n\to M\) of open sets
  \(U_\alpha\) of \(\bbR^n\) into \(M\) such that:
  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*),noitemsep]
  \item \(\bigcup_\alpha\bfx_\alpha(U_\alpha)=M\);
  \item for any pair \(\alpha\), \(\beta\), with
    \(\bfx_\alpha(U_\alpha)\cap\bfx_\beta(U_\beta)=W\neq\emptyset\), the
    sets \(\bfx_\alpha^{-1}(W)\) and \(\bfx_\beta^{-1}(W)\) are open sets
    in \(\bbR^n\) and the mappings \(\bfx_\beta^{-1}\circ\bfx_\alpha\) are
    differentiable;
  \item the family \(\{(U_\alpha,\bfx_\alpha)\}\) is maximal relative to
    the conditions (1) and (2).
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

The pair \((U_\alpha,\bfx_\alpha)\) with \(p\in\bfx_\alpha(U_\alpha)\) is
called a \emph{parametrization} (or \emph{system of coordinates}) of \(M\)
at \(p\); \(\bfx_\alpha(U_\alpha)\) is then called a \emph{coordinate
  neighborhood} at \(p\). A family \(\{(U_\alpha,\bfx_\alpha)\}\)
satisfying (1) and (2) is called a \emph{differentiable structure} on
\(M\).
