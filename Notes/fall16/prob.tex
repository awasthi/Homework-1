\chapter{Probability}
A brief summary of the probability we learned this semester in MA 51900
(discrete probability -- yeah, I know). Our references will be (mostly)
Feller's \emph{An introduction to probability theory and its applications,
  Volume 1} \cite{feller} and DasGupta's \emph{Fundamentals of Probability:
A First Course}\cite{dasgupta}.

\section{Discrete Probability}
We will follow the first few chapters of \cite{feller} for this part of the
chapter (which is discrete probability) and \cite{dasgupta} for the rest.
