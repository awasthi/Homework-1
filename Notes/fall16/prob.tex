\chapter{Probability}
We will devote this chapter to the material that is covered in MA 51900
(discrete probability) as it was covered in DasGupta's class. We will, for
the most part, reference Feller's \emph{An introduction to probability
  theory and its applications, Volume 1} \cite{feller} (especially for the
discrete noncalculus portion of the class) and DasGupta's own book
\emph{Fundamentals of Probability: A First Course} \cite{dasgupta}.
