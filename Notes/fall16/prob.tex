\chapter{Probability}
A brief summary of the probability we learned this semester in MA 51900
(discrete probability -- yeah, I know). Our references will be (mostly)
Feller's \emph{An introduction to probability theory and its applications,
  Volume 1} \cite{feller} and DasGupta's \emph{Fundamentals of Probability:
A First Course}\cite{dasgupta}.

\section{The Basics}
In this section we will talk about concepts related to discrete
probability. Before we begin, we introduce the axioms we will be working
under. First and foremost, to do probability we need a \emph{sample space
  \(\Omega\)} and a \emph{probability \(p\colon\calM\to[0,1]\)} which
assigns values between \(0\) and \(1\) to \emph{special} subsets of
\(\Omega\) which we denote by \(\calM\) (more formally, this \(\calM\) is
called a
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigma-algebra}{\emph{\(\sigma\)-algebra}}
by analysts or a \emph{algebra of events} by probabilists and \(p\) is
called a
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_measure}{\emph{probability
    measure}} and there are certain axioms it must satisfy for us to be
able to assign consistent values to subsets of \(\Omega\) with \(p\)). An
element \(\omega\in\Omega\) is called a \emph{sample point} and a (special)
collection of \(\omega\), \(A\in\calM\), is called an event. We call the
triplet \((\Omega,\calM,p)\) a probability space.

The algebra of events comes \(\calM\) with a natural multiplication and
addition given, naturally, by union and intersection of events (\ie{}
\(A+B\defeq A\cup B\) and \(AB\defeq A\cap B\)) and an additive as well as
multiplicative identity \(\emptyset\) and \(\Omega\), \etc{} If
\(AB=\emptyset\) we say that the events \(A\) and \(B\) are \emph{mutually
  exclusive}.
\begin{remark}
  We won't always use the notation \(A+B\) and \(AB\) to mean \(A\cup B\)
  and \(A\cap B\), respectively (since I prefer the set-theoretic notation
  over the algebraic one), but Prof.\@ DasGupta makes has a preference for
  the latter and Feller uses a mix of the two. Now, you may ask ``Why
  introduce this notation at all if you are going to disregard it?'' The
  reason is that I will be using examples from Feller and DasGupta's book
  and sometimes I will be too rushed to bother translating the notation and
  though I don't expect anybody but myself to read this, it may very well
  happen that I pass these notes on to somebody else.
\end{remark}

In this section, we shall assume that our sample space \(\Omega\) is
discrete, \ie{} \(\#\Omega<\infty\) or at the very least \(\aleph^0\). We
additionally require that for each point \(\omega\) in the space \(\Omega\)
its probability \(P(\omega)\) in non-negative and
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:convention-prob}
  \sum_{\omega\in\Omega}P(\omega)=1.
\end{equation}

There are of course a whole number of beautiful relationships that \(p\)
satisfies (those that any sane measure would satisfy like countable
additivity, subadditivity, \etc{}), but we shall not talk about them here,
instead let us get down to the crux of the matter (at least at this point
in the class): counting. Since our sample spaces will be finite (at least
for now), we need to be able to count sample points in \(\Omega\) by way of
combinatorics (this is in my opinion, a lot tougher than working with
infinite sample spaces for which we must make certain assumptions about the
sample points and the probability measure -- it is less tedious to solve
problems with sane assumptions than it is to count points).

\subsection{Basic Combinatorics}
It is often reasonable to assume that the probability of any particular
sample point \(\omega\in\Omega\) is just as likely as that of any other
sample point. We say that in such a sample space each sample point is
\emph{equally likely} to happen. This means that the probability of
\(\omega\in\Omega\) happening is precisely
\[
  P(\omega)=\frac{1}{\#\Omega}.
\]
Thus, to compute the probability of an event \(A\), we need clever ways of
counting points.
