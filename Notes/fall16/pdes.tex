\chapter{Introduction to Partial Differential Equations}
Here we summarize some important points about PDEs. The material is mostly
taken from Evans's \emph{Partial Differential Equations} \cite{evans} with
occasional detours to Strauss's \emph{Partial Differential Equations: An
  Introduction} \cite{strauss}. We will be following Dr.\@ Petrosyan's
\textsf{Course Log} which can be found here
\url{https://www.math.purdue.edu/~arshak/F16/MA523/courselog/}, i.e.,
summarizing the appropriate chapters from \cite{evans}.
