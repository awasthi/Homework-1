\chapter{Introduction to Partial Differential Equations}
Here we summarize some important points about PDEs. The material is mostly
taken from Evans's \emph{Partial Differential Equations} \cite{evans} with
occasional detours to Strauss's \emph{Partial Differential Equations: An
  Introduction} \cite{strauss}.
