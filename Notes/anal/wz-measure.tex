\section{Preliminaries}
Here are some results if think were useful to look over.

If $\calF$ is a countable collection of sets, it will be called a
\emph{sequence of sets} and denoted $\calF=\left\{E_k:k=1,...\right\}$. The
corresponding union and intersection will be written $\bigcup_k E_k$ and
$\bigcap_k E_k$. A sequence of $\left\{E_k\right\}$ of sets is said to
\emph{increase} to $\bigcup_k E_k$ if $E_k\subset E_{k+1}$ and to
\emph{decrease} to $\bigcap_k E_k$ to denote these two possibilities. If
$\left\{E_k\right\}_{k=1}^\infty$ is a sequence of sets, we define
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:liminf-limsup-sets}
\varlimsup E_k=\bigcap_{j=1}^\infty\bigcup_{k=j}^\infty E_k,\qquad
\varliminf E_k=\bigcup_{j=1}^\infty\bigcap_{k=j}^\infty E_k,
\end{equation}
noting that the sets $U_j=\bigcup_{k=j}^\infty E_k$
