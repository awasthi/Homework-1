title: "Let's Celebrate Good Reviewing"
excerpt: |
    I believe that peer reviewing in our community is worse than necessary. Specifically, the conference system does not incentivize thoughtful reviewing: it encourages hasty, conservative reviews. A new publication model should focus on the quality of peer review as a primary concern.

This [hypothetical journal][journalpost] should be focused on celebrating good reviews. Good reviewing is an under-appreciated, and therefore under-practiced, trade in our field.

I don't know why reviews are bad, there are lots of theories from assignment to accountability to delegation, but I do know the incentives do not exist systematically to encourage good reviews.

Secret reviews inhibit our ability to have a sustained conversation about what makes good research. Which contributes to the barriers to entering the community (not to mention inhibiting its ability to change with the times).

The way we can combat this is by bringing reviews to the forefront. The hypothetical journal will focus on reviews that are worth publishing. The goal should be to produce opinions about papers that help place papers in context and fairly weight the merits.

Something like Computing Reviews.

Since published papers will implicitly be over an acceptability "line", these public reviews should be free to be gently negative. They don't have to just sing praises; they can be balanced in their criticism. The truth is that no paper is perfect; we should pretend that they are. Writing clearly and frankly about what makes a paper good---and what makes it imperfect---is a resource that we have precious little of currently. It has so many benefits:

* The right incentive for writing good reviews.
* Provides and example to junior reviewers about how good reviews can be. Instructive.
* A starting point for broader discussions---about the paper itself and about the criteria we have for choosing good papers.
