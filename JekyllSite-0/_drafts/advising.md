title: "On Advising: Note to My Future Self"
excerpt: |
    I want to be a Ph.D. advisor. Being a Ph.D. advisee has given me unfounded, wildly impractical ideas about how advisors should advise. This is my advice to my future, advisorly self.
---
The denouement of my Ph.D. has, predictably, made me feel introspective. In the hopes that it will soon be my problem to worry about, I've been thinking about what makes a good advisor. Being blessed with [great][luis] [advisors][dan] has made me worry even more about how easily things can and do go wrong.

At the risk of offending any *real* advisors with the profound naivet√©, this is unsolicited advice for advisors from an advisee's perspective.

## Pay Attention

An advisor's flavor is dominated by how directly they interact with a student's research. Often oversimplified to "Hands-on or hands-off?". Clearly this changes over the course of a grad student's trek through their Ph.D. It's incredibly easy to be overbearing, and equally easy to be absent.

There are actually two factors at work: *attention* and *close monitoring* (pejoratively, micromanagement). Newer students and people with less research experience need more of the latter. But *everyone* needs the former. You're never excused from paying attention to needs and communicating goals. Older students may need *more* attention than newer people.

## Own the High-Stakes Decisions

When a project is successful, it's to the student's credit for doing the amazing work. When a project fails, it's the advisor's fault for mismanaging.

shaping the project is your biggest responsibility. setting the goal. avoiding quagmires.
relatedly, managing ownership and participation. avoiding time sinks. what shape should the org chart be? IMO, probably one student at the top for every project; don't just expect the chain of command to self-organize.

## Practice Extreme Empathy

Alternate section title: "Do not, under any circumstances, be yourself."

Good advising does not come naturally. You can't interact with your students in the way that seems most natural, or even the most comfortable. People have specific needs for how they're motivated, how they're made to feel successful, etc.

This is a perversion of the golden rule. You need to fight your natural instincts to treat everyone how you once wanted to be treated as a grad student. It is hard to think carefully about exactly which words of encouragement someone needs at a particular time, especially when they're different from how you operate. But this kind of extreme empathy is the essence of mentoring.

## Resist the Boss Mentality

Fight the normal boss mentality where you both are in it for number 1

This is okay in the role of a student who needs to figure out how to make people happy in order to get what they want. Not okay in an advisor who needs tL actively put students before their own career. Special that way

I talk to so many other grad students who talk about demanding expectations and an adversarial relationship. I've been lucky

## Overcommunicate

Err on the side of overcommunication

You obviously have to hide some things strategically to avoid overwhelming students (and breaches of professionalism). But work hard to communicate everything that you don't have a reason for hiding. Some politics that you'd prefer to abstract away, or some decision-making details that are just tiresome to explain: explain them. Hiding them systematically hides students from the real way research gets done.

Not only is this important for morale but it's critical to learning how research is done. If things seem to happen out of the blue, if things change when you're not looking, you can't develop intuition about how decisions are made.

## Criticize

There is a difference between making someone feel bad, being overbearing, and speaking your mind. Giving criticism is not mean.

Personally, I have a problem where I am so afraid of discouraging people that I over-correct. I think this is common among nerds. Overcompensation leads us to be afraid to give strong, confident criticism. I got nice in the bag; what I need is a little mean!

The thing is it's not hard to be nice while speaking your mind. You can even be wrong sometimes, but you need to give people guidance. Otherwise you're doing them a disservice.

Spectrum:

* Abusive, what I'm too afraid of: "You spelled this wrong! You can't write! Do five spelling worksheets before you try again!"
* Unhelpful, what I'm actually prone to: "That's nice! Very creative! Can you see any words here that you might want to spell differently?"
* The right thing: "This is how it's spelled."
