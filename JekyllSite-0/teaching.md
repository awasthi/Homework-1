### Recitation

I have common office hours this semester. Find my name on this
[table][office-hours]. Of course, if you cannot make it to my office hours
other TAs will be able to help you.

I will post my recitation notes and solutions to recitation quizzes here,
for those of you who would like something to study from for the exams. I
take many of my quiz questions from the [past exam archive][past-exams] for
MA 166.
