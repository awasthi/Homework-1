  identically distributed \(\Uniform[0,1]\) random variables
  \(X_1,\dotsc,X_m\). Let \(X_{\text{min}}\) denote their minimum and

  \(X_{m+1},\dotsc,\) from the \(\Uniform[0,1]\) density. Let \(N\) be the

\begin{problem}
  A \(G_{n,p}\) graph on \(n\) vartices is obtained by adding each of the
  \(\binom{n}{2}\) possible edges into the graph mutually independently
  with probability \(p\). If vertex subsets \(A\), \(B\) both have \(k\)
  vertices, and each vertex \(A\) shares an edge with each vertex in \(B\),
  but there are no edges among the vertices within \(A\) or within \(B\),
  then \(A\), \(B\) generate a complete bipartate subgraph of order \(k\)
  denoted as \(K_{k,k}\).
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item[(a)] For a given \(n\) and \(p\), find an expression for the
    expected number of complete bipartate subgraphs \(K_{3,3}\) of order
    \(k=3\) in a \(G_5n,p\) graph.
  \item[(b)] Let \(p_n\) denote the value of \(p\) for which the expected
    value in part (a) equals one. Identify constants \(\alpha\), \(\beta\)
    such that \(\lim_{n\to\infty}n^\alpha p_n=\beta\).
