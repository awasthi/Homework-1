\begin{problem}
  The number of fish that Anirban catches on any given day has a Poisson
  distribution with mean \(20\). Due to the legendary softness of his
  heart, he sets free, on average, \(3\) out of the \(4\) fish he
  catches. Find the mean and the variance of the number of fish Anirban
  takes home on a given day.
