\begin{problem}[Handout 2, \# 13]
  \emph{Spread of rumors.} In a town of \(n+1\) inhabitants, a person tells
  a rumor to a second person, who in turn repeats it to a third person,
  etc. At each step the recipient of the rumor is chosen at random from the
  \(n\) people available. Find the probability that the rumor told \(r\)
  times without:
  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*),noitemsep]
  \item returning to the originator,
  \item being repeated to any person.
  \end{enumerate}
  Do the same problem when at each step the rumor told by one person to a
  gathering of \(N\) randomly chosen people. (The first question is the
  special case \(N=1\)).

\begin{problem}[Handout 2, \# 14]
  \emph{A family problem.} In a certain family four girls take turns at
  washing dishes. Out of a total of four breakages, three were caused by
  the youngest girl, and she was thereafter called clumsy. Was she
  justified in attributing the frequency of breakages to chance? Discuss
  the connection with random placement of balls.

\begin{problem}[Handout 2, \# 15]
  A car is parked among \(N\) cars in a row, not at either end. On his
  return the owner finds exactly \(r\) of the \(N\) places still
  occupied. What is the probability that both neighboring places are empty?

\begin{problem}[Handout 2, \# 18]
  Suppose you have infinitely many events \(A_1,A_2,\dotsc\), and each one
  is sure to occur, i.e., \(P(A_i)=1\) for any \(i\).

  \noindent Prove that \(P\bigl(\bigcap_{i=1}^n A_i\bigr)=1\).
