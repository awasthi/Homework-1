\begin{problem}[Handout 2, \# 5]
  Four men throw their watches into the sea, and the sea brings each man
  one watch back at random. What is the probability that at least one man
  gets his own watch back?
\end{problem}
\begin{solution*}
  Suppose \(4\) men throw their watches into the sea. Label these men ``the
  \(i\)\textsup{th} man'' for \(1\leq i\leq 4\). Let \(A_i\) denote the
  probability that the \(i\)\textsup{th} man gets his own watch back. Then
  the probability that at least one man gets his own watch back is the
  event \(A=A_1\cup A_2\cup A_3\cup A_4\). By the inclusion-exclusion
  principle, we have
  \[
    \begin{aligned}
      P(
      A)&=P(A_1)+P(A_2)+P(A_3)+P(A_4)\\
      &\phantom{{}={}}-P(A_1\cap A_2)-P(A_1\cap A_3)-P(A_1\cap A_4)\\
      &\phantom{{}={}}-P(A_2\cap A_3)-P(A_2\cap A_4)-P(A_3\cap A_4)\\
      &\phantom{{}={}}+P(A_1\cap A_2\cap A_3)+P(A_1\cap A_2\cap A_4)\\
      &\phantom{{}={}}+P(A_1\cap A_3\cap A_4)+P(A_2\cap A_3\cap A_4)\\
      &\phantom{{}={}}-P(A_1\cap A_2\cap A_3\cap A_4).
    \end{aligned}
  \]
  Since the probabilities \(P(A_i)=P(A_j)\), \(P(A_i\cap A_j)=P(A_k\cap
  A_\ell)\), etc., the equation above reduces to
  \[
    P(A)=4P(A_1)-6P(A_1\cap A_2)+4P(A_1\cap A_2\cap A_3)-P(A_1\cap A_2\cap
    A_3\cap A_4).
  \]
  All we need to do now is fill in the blanks. Intuitively, the probability
  that the \(1\)\textsup{st} man gets back his own wallet is \(1/4\) since
  only one wallet is his own out of the \(4\). Now, the probability that
  the \(1\)\textsup{st} and the \(2\)\textsup{nd} man get their own wallet
  back is \((1/4)(1/3)=1/2\). Proceeding in this fashion, we have
  \[
    P(A)=4\cdot\frac{1}{4}-6\cdot\frac{1}{12}+4\cdot\frac{1}{24}-\frac{1}{24}
    =0.625.
  \]
\end{solution*}

\begin{problem}[Handout 2, \# 7]
  Calculate the probability that in Bridge, the hand of at least one player
  is void in a particular suit.
\end{problem}
\begin{solution*}
  Label the players ``player \(i\)'' for \(1\leq i\leq 4\). Let \(A_i\)
  denote the event that player \(i\) is void in a particular suit. Then
  the probability of the event \(A\) that at least one player is void in a
  particular suit is \(P(A)=P\bigl(\bigcup_{i=1}^4 A_i\bigr)\). Again, we
  can decompose this into
  \[
    P(A)=4P(A_1)-6P(A_1\cap A_2)+4P(A_1\cap A_2\cap A_3)-P(A_1\cap A_2\cap
    A_3\cap A_4).
  \]
  Thus, it suffices to fill in the blanks in the equation above, i.e., find
  the probabilities \(P(A_1)\), \(P(A_1\cap A_2)\), etc. To this end, the
  probability that player \(1\) is void in a particular suit, say red

\begin{problem}[Handout 2, \# 13]
  \emph{Spread of rumors.} In a town of \(n+1\) inhabitants, a person tells
  a rumor to a second person, who in turn repeats it to a third person,
  etc. At each step the recipient of the rumor is chosen at random from the
  \(n\) people available. Find the probability that the rumor told \(r\)
  times without:
  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*),noitemsep]
  \item returning to the originator,
  \item being repeated to any person.

  Do the same problem when at each step the rumor told by one person to a
  gathering of \(N\) randomly chosen people. (The first question is the
  special case \(N=1\)).
