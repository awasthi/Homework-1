\begin{problem}[Handout 3, \# 3]
  \(n\) sticks are broken into one short and one long part. The \(2n\)
  parts are then randomly paired up to form \(n\) new sticks. Find the
  probability that
  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*),noitemsep]
  \item the parts are joined in their original order, i.e., the new sticks
    are the same as the old sticks;
  \item each long part is paired up with a short part.

  \emph{(Polygraphs).} Polygraphs are routinely administered to job
  applicants for sensitive government positions. Suppose someone actually
  lying fails the polygraph \(90\%\) of the time. But someone telling the
  truth also fails the polygraph \(15\%\) of the time. If a polygraph
  indicates that an applicant is lying, what is the probability that he is
  in fact telling the truth? Assume a general prior probability \(p\) that
  the person is telling the truth.
