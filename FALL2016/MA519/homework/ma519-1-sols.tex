\begin{problem}[Handout 1, \# 5]
  A closet contains five pairs of shoes. If four shoes are selected at
  random, what is the probability that there is at least one complete pair
  among the four?
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
  Let \(A\) denote the event that ``at least \(1\) complete pair is among
  the \(4\) selected shoes.'' We compute the probability of \(\lnot A\) the
  event that there is no complete pair among the \(4\) selected shoes.

  We can choose \(4\) shoes from the \(5\) pairs in \(\binom{10}{4}=210\)
  ways (this is the order of the sample space), in order that we do not
  select a pair, we choose one of \(2\) a left or a right from \(4\) pairs
  of shoes which can be chosen in \(\binom{5}{4}\) ways.

  Thus,
  \begin{align*}
    P(A)
    &=1-P(\lnot A)\\
    &=1-\frac{\binom{5}{4}2^4}{\binom{10}{4}}\\
    &=1-\frac{8}{21}\\
    &\approx\boxed{\num{0.6190476190476191}.}
  \end{align*}

\begin{problem}[Handout 1, \# 7]
  A gene consists of \(10\) subunits, each of which is normal or
  mutant. For a particular cell, there are \(3\) mutant and \(7\) normal
  subunits. Before the cell divides into \(2\) daughter cells, the gene
  duplicates. The corresponding gene of cell \(1\) consists of \(10\)
  subunits chosen from the \(6\) mutant and \(14\) normal units. Cell \(2\)
  gets the rest. What is the probability that one of the cells consists of
  all normal subunits.

\begin{problem}[Handout 1, \# 9]
  From a sample of size \(n\), \(r\) elements are sampled at random. Find

  \item without replacement.
