\section{Homework Solutions}
These are my (corrected) solutions to DasGupta's Math/Stat 519 homework for
the fall semester of 2016.
\subsection{Homework 1}
\begin{problem}[Handout 1, \# 5]
  A closet contains five pairs of shoes. If four shoes are selected at
  random, what is the probability that there is at least one complete pair
  among the four?
\end{problem}
\begin{solution*}
  There are \(\binom{10}{4}=210\) to choose four shoes from five
  pairs. Therefore, the size of the sample space is \(|\Omega|=210\) and,
  under the equally-likely hypothesis, each sample point \(x\in\Omega\) has
  probability \(\frac{1}{210}\).

  We compute the probability of the complement; i.e., the probability that
  there is no complete pair among the four randomly selected shoes. To
  avoid selecting a pair we choose must choose of two (a left or a right)
  shoes from four pairs which we can do in \(\binom{5}{5}=5\) different
  ways.

  Thus, the probability that at least one pair of shoes is among the four
  randomly selected shoes is
  \begin{align*}
    P(\text{one pair is among the four})
    &=1-P(\text{no pair is among the four})\\
    &=1-\frac{5\cdot 2^4}{210}\\
    &=1-\frac{8}{21}\\
    &=\num{0.6190476190476191}.\qedhere
  \end{align*}
\end{solution*}

\begin{problem}[Handout 1, \# 7]
  A gene consists of \(10\) subunits, each of which is normal or
  mutant. For a particular cell, there are \(3\) mutant and \(7\) normal
  subunits. Before the cell divides into \(2\) daughter cells, the gene
  duplicates. The corresponding gene of cell \(1\) consists of \(10\)
  subunits chosen from the \(6\) mutant and \(14\) normal units. Cell \(2\)
  gets the rest. What is the probability that one of the cells consists of
  all normal subunits.
\end{problem}
\begin{solution*}
  Assuming we can arrange these subunits in any possible order, there are
  \(\binom{20}{10}=\num{184756}\) possible gene combinations in any of
  these daughter cells.
\end{solution*}

\begin{problem}[Handout 1, \# 9]
  From a sample of size \(n\), \(r\) elements are sampled at random. Find
  the probability that none of the \(N\) prespecified elements are included
  in the sample, if sampling is
  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*),noitemsep]
  \item with replacement;
  \item without replacement.
  \end{enumerate}
  Compute it for \(r=N=10\), \(n=100\).
\end{problem}
\begin{solution*}
  For part (a), the sample space contains \(|\Omega|=n^r\) elements; these
  correspond to all of the possible draws of \(r\) with replacement. If
  \(n\) elements are specified, \(n-N\) have not and therefore, there are
  \((n-N)^r\) ways of drawing \(r\) of the non-prespecified elements. Thus,
  the probability that note of the \(N\) prespecified elements are drawn if
  we sample \(r\) elements randomly with replacement is
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:1:with-replacement}
    p_1(n,N,r)=\frac{(n-N)^r}{n^r}.
  \end{equation}

  The argument for part (b) is similar. There number of elements in the
  sample space is \(|\Omega|=\binom{n}{r}\); these correspond to the
  passible draws of \(r\) elements without replacement. As before, \(n-N\)
  of the elements have not been prespecified and therefore, we have
  \(\binom{n-N}{r}\) ways of drawing \(r\) of the non-prespecified
  elements. Thus, the probability that note of the \(N\) prespecified
  elements are drawn if we sample \(r\) elements randomly without
  replacement is
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:1:without-replacement}
    p_2(n,N,r)=\frac{\binom{n-N}{r}}{\binom{n}{r}}.
  \end{equation}

  Finally, we compute \(p_1\) and \(p_2\) for \(r=N=10\), \(n=100\) using
  equations \eqref{eq:1:with-replacement} and
  \eqref{eq:1:without-replacement} above:
  \begin{align*}
    p_1(100,10,10)&\approx\num{0.3486784401},\\
    p_2(100,10,10)&\approx\num{0.3304762208462021}.\qedhere
  \end{align*}
\end{solution*}

\begin{problem}[Handout 1, \# 11]
  Let \(E\), \(F\), and \(G\) be three events. Find expressions for the
  following events:
  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*),noitemsep]
  \item only \(E\) occurs;
  \item both \(E\) and \(G\) occur, but not \(F\);
  \item all three occur;
  \item at least one of the events occurs;
  \item at most two of them occur.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{problem}
\begin{solution*}
  For part (a), the event ``from \(E\), \(F\), and \(G\) only \(E\)
  occurs'' is given by
  \[
    E\cap(\Omega\setminus F)\cap(\Omega\setminus G).
  \]

  For part (b), the event ``from \(E\), \(F\), and \(G\) both \(E\) and
  \(G\) occur, but not \(F\)'' is given by
  \[
    E\cap G\cap(\Omega\setminus F).
  \]

  For part (c), the event ``from \(E\), \(F\), and \(G\) all three occur''
  is given by
  \[
    E\cap F\cap G.
  \]

  For part (d), the event ``from \(E\), \(F\), and \(G\) at least one
  occurs'' is given by
  \[
    E\cup F\cup G.
  \]

  For part (e), the event ``from \(E\), \(F\), and \(G\) at most two
  occur'' is given by
  \[
    \bigl(E\cap F\cap(\Omega\setminus G)\bigr)\cup%
    \bigl(E\cap (\Omega\setminus F)\cap G\bigr)\cup%
    \bigl((\Omega\setminus E)\cap F\cap G\bigr).\qedhere
  \]
\end{solution*}

\begin{problem}[Handout 1, \# 12]
  Which is more likely:
  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*),noitemsep]
  \item Obtaining at least one six in six rolls of a fair die, or
  \item Obtaining at least one double six in six rolls of a pair of fair
    dice.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{problem}
\begin{solution*}
  For both (a) and (b), we shall compute the probability of the complement
  of the event in question.

  For part (a), the event that ``we do not roll a six in six rolls of a
  fair die'' is given by
  \[
    q_1=\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^6\approx\num{0.3348979766803842}.
  \]
  Therefore, the probability of seeing at least one six in six rolls of a
  fair die is
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:1:six-in-six-rolls}
    p_1=1-q_1\approx\num{0.6651020233196159}.
  \end{equation}

  For part (b),
  % For part (b), we, again, compute the probability of the complement of the
  % event, i.e., the event that no double \(6\) is rolled. This is
  % \[
  %   P(A)=1-P(\lnot
  %   A)=1-\left(\frac{35}{36}\right)^6\approx\num{0.15551243015966854}.
  % \]
  % \\\\
  % Therefore, it is more likely that you roll a \(6\) in \(6\) rolls of a
  % fair die than that you roll a double \(6\) in \(6\) rolls of a pair of
  % fair dice.
\end{solution*}

\begin{problem}[Handout 1, \# 13]
  There are \(n\) people are lined up at random for a photograph. What is
  the probability that a specified set of \(r\) people happen to be next to
  each other?
\end{problem}
\begin{solution*}
  The \(r\) specified people can stand as a group starting at positions
  \(1,2,\dotsc,n-r+1\). They can be permuted among themselves in \(r!\)
  ways. The remaining \(n-r\) people can be permuted among themselves in
  \((n-r)!\) ways. Thus, we have
  \[
    P=\frac{(n-r+1)r!(n-r)!}{n!}=\frac{(n-r+1)!r!}{n!}.\qedhere
  \]
\end{solution*}

\begin{problem}[Handout 1, \# 16]
  Consider a particular player, say North, in a Bridge game. Let \(X\) be
  the number of aces in his hand. Find the distribution of \(X\).
\end{problem}
\begin{solution*}
  The number of aces in North's hand \(X\) is a random variable which takes
  integer values between \(0\) and \(4\). Therefore, we must compute the
  probabilities \(P(X=x)\), \(0\leq x\leq 4\).

  From a deck with \(52\) cards, \(13\) cards can be selected in
  \(\binom{52}{13}\) ways among which the player will have \(x\) number of
  aces in \(\binom{4}{x}\binom{48}{13-x}\) ways. Thus, the distribution is
  given by
  \[
    P(X=x)=\frac{\binom{4}{x}\binom{48}{13-x}}{\binom{52}{13}}.
  \]
  The explicit values are approximately
  \begin{align*}
    P(X=0)&\approx 0.304,
    &P(X=1)&\approx 0.439,\\
    P(X=2)&\approx 0.213,
    &P(X=3)&\approx 0.041,\\
    P(X=4)&\approx 0.003.\qedhere
  \end{align*}
\end{solution*}

\begin{problem}[Handout 1, \# 20]
  If \(100\) balls are distributed completely at random into \(100\) cells,
  find the expected value of the number of empty cells.

  \noindent Replace \(100\) by \(n\) and derive the general expression. Now
  approximate it as \(n\) tends to \(\infty\).
\end{problem}
\begin{solution*}
  Let \(X\) be the random variable denoting the number of empty
  cells. Define indicator variables \(X_1,\dotsc,X_n\) by
  \[
    X_k=
    \begin{cases}
      1&\text{if the \(i\)\textsup{th} cell is empty,}\\
      0&\text{otherwise.}
    \end{cases}
  \]
  Then
  \[
    X=\sum_{k=1}^n X_k
  \]
  and so the mean of this random variable is given by
  \begin{align*}
    E(X)
    &=\sum_{k=1}^n E(X_k)\\
    &=\sum_{k=1}^n P(X_k=1)\\
    &=\sum_{k=1}^n\frac{(n-1)^n}{n^n}\\
    &=n\left(1-\frac{1}{n}\right)^n,
  \end{align*}
  which approaches \(\infty\) as \(n\to\infty\) since
  \(\bigl(1-\frac{1}{n}\bigr)^n\to \rme^{-1}\).
  \\\\
  For \(n=100\), we have \(E(X)\approx 36.60\).
\end{solution*}
