\begin{problem}[Handout 8, \# 2]
  Identify the parameters \(n\) and \(p\) for each of the following
  binomial distributions:
  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*),noitemsep]
  \item \(\#\) boys in a family with \(5\) children;
  \item \(\#\) correct answers in a multiple choice test if each
    question has a \(5\) alternatives, there are \(25\) questions, and the
    student is making guesses at random.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
  For part (a), the distribution is binomial with \(k\) being the number of
  children in a given family and \(p\) the probability that a child is
  born, say, male. In this case, we can reasonably assume that
  \(p=0.5\). Thus, the binomial distribution is given by
  \(\Binom(5,0.5)\).
  \\\\
  For part (b), we use similar reasoning and we have \(\Binom(25,0.2)\)
  where \(k=25\) is the number of questions and \(p=1/5=0.2\) the
  probability of guessing a question correctly.

\begin{problem}[Handout 8, \# 10]
  A newsboy purchases papers at \(20\) cents and sells them for \(35\)
  cents. He cannot return unsold papers. If the daily demand for papers is
  modeled as a \(\Binom(50,0.5)\) random variable, what is the optimum
  number of papers the newsboy should purchase?
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
  Let \(X\sim\Binom(50,0.5)\) denote the daily demand for papers and \(n\)
  the number of copies bought by the newsboy. Then, the random variable
  \(S=\min\{X,n\}\) denotes the number of copies actually sold by the
  newsboy. His daily profit is, therefore, measured by the random variable
  \[
    Y=0.35S-0.25n.
  \]

  Now let us compute the average sales of the newsboy. By the linearity of
  expected value, we have
  \begin{align*}
    E(S)
    &=\sum_{k=0}^nkP(S=k)\\
    &=\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} kP(\min\{X,n\}=k)+nP(\min\{X,n\}=n),
      \intertext{where \(P(\min\{X,n\}=k)=P(X=k)\) the probability that there
      is a demand for \(k\) copies, and \(P(\min\{X,n\}=n)=P(X\geq n)\) the
      probability that the demand exceeds the number of copies the newsboy
      bought, giving us}
    &=\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} kP(X=k)+nP(X\geq n)\\
    &=\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} kP(X=k)+n\bigl(1-P(X<n)\bigr).
  \end{align*}

  Binomial approximation to the hypergeometric distribution. A population

  replacement. The probability that it contains exactly \(k\) red elements
