\begin{problem}[Handout 2, \# 5]
  Four men throw their watches into the sea, and the sea brings each man
  one watch back at random. What is the probability that at least one man
  gets his own watch back?
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
  The sample space \(\Omega\) is in correspondence with \(S_4\) the set of
  bijections from the set \(\{1,2,3,4\}\) to itself and therefore
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:2-1}
    \#\Omega=\# S_4=4!=24.
  \end{equation}
  Let \(A\) denote the event that at least one man gets his own watch
  back. This is a case where it is easier find the probability of the
  complement of \(A\), i.e., the event \(\Omega\setminus A\) that no man
  gets his own watch back.

  In this case, we can explicitly list the ways in which no man gets his
  own watch back: We can translate, i.e., each man receives the \(i\)-th
  man to the left's watch (there are \(3\) ways to do this before the
  everybody receives their own watch back); and we can transpose watches
  between any two any two men (there are \(3\) ways to do this as choosing
  one pair of men to trade watches determines the other pair). In summary,
  there are \(6\) ways for each man to not get his own wallet back. Thus,
  \[
    P(\Omega\setminus A)=\frac{6}{24}=0.25
  \]
  and hence
  \[
    P(A)=1-P(\Omega\setminus A)=0.75.
  \]

  Calculate the probability that in Bridge, the hand of at least one player
  is void in a particular suit.
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
  Let \(\Omega\) denote the sample space and \(A\) denote the event that at
  least one player is void in a particular suit. As in the previous
  problem, it is easier to compute the probability of \(\Omega\setminus A\)
  the event that no player is void in a particular suit. But first, we
  count the number of sample points in \(\Omega\)
  \[
    \#\Omega=\binom{52}{13,13,13,13}
  \]

\begin{problem}[Handout 2, \# 13]
  \emph{Spread of rumors.} In a town of \(n+1\) inhabitants, a person tells
  a rumor to a second person, who in turn repeats it to a third person,
  etc. At each step the recipient of the rumor is chosen at random from the
  \(n\) people available. Find the probability that the rumor told \(r\)
  times without:
  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*),noitemsep]
  \item returning to the originator,
  \item being repeated to any person.
  \end{enumerate}
  Do the same problem when at each step the rumor told by one person to a
  gathering of \(N\) randomly chosen people. (The first question is the
  special case \(N=1\)).
