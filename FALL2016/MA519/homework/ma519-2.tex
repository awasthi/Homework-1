  \emph{Spread of rumors.} In a town of \(n+1\) inhabitants, a person tells
  a rumor to a second person, who in turn repeats it to a third person,
  \etc At each step the recipient of the rumor is chosen at random from the
  \(n\) people available. Find the probability that the rumor told \(r\)
  times without: (a) returning to the originator, (b) being repeated to any
  person. Do the same problem when at each step the rumor told by one
  person to a gathering of \(N\) randomly chosen people. (The first
  question is the special case \(N=1\)).

  washing dishes. Out of a total of four breakages, three were caused by
  the youngest girl, and she was thereafter called clumsy. Was she
  justified in attributing the frequency of breakages to chance? Discuss
