\begin{problem}[DasGupta, 1.5]
  The population of Danville is \(20000\). Can it be said with certainty
  that there must be two or more people in Danville with exactly the same
  three initials?
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
  Yes. To see this we provide the following purely combinatorial
  argument. Let \(A\) denote the event that two or more people in Danville
  have exactly the same three initials and consider its converse
  \(A^\sfc\), \ie{}, the event that no two people in Danvillle have
  exactly the same three initials. Since the Latin alphabet consists of
  \(26\) letters to any given person we may assign one of \(26^3=17576\)
  possible initials. Since there are \(20000\) people living in Danville by
  the pigeon-hole principle there must be two people (in fact, as many as
  \(20000-17576=2424\)) with the same three initials.

\begin{problem}[DasGupta, 1.9]
  n which of the following are events \(A\) and \(B\) mutually exclusive?
  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*),noitemsep]
  \item Roll two dice. \(A\) is the event of a sum of 9; \(B\) is the event of
    a double (i.e., the same value on both dice).
  \item Draw 13 cards from a deck of 52 cards. \(A\) is the event of drawing at
    least one club; \(B\) is the event of drawing no aces.
  \item Toss a coin twice. \(A\) is the event of a head on the first toss;
    \(B\) is the event of a head on the second toss.

  \emph{Spread of rumors.} In a town of \(n+1\) inhabitants, a person tells
  a rumor to a second person, who in turn repeats it to a third person,
  \etc{} At each step the recipient of the rumor is chosen at random from the
  \(n\) people available. Find the probability that the rumor told \(r\)
  times without:
  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*),noitemsep]
  \item returning to the originator,
  \item being repeated to any person.

  Do the same problem when at each step the rumor told by one person to a
  gathering of \(N\) randomly chosen people. (The first question is the
