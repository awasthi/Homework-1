\begin{problem}[Handout 1, \# 5 \protect{[Feller Vol. \@ 1]}]
  A closet contains five pairs of shoes. If four shoes are selected at
  random, what is the probability that there is at least one complete pair
  among the four?
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
  \emph{We shall assume throughout our homework, unless otherwise stated,
    that all sample points are equally likely!}
  \\\\
  First, since the closet contains \(5\) pairs of shoes, it contains, in
  total, \(10\) shoes.

  A gene consists of \(10\) subunits, each of which is normal or
  mutant. For a particular cell, there are \(3\) mutant and \(7\) normal
  subunits. Before the cell divides into \(2\) daughter cells, the gene
  duplicates. The corresponding gene of cell \(1\) consists of \(10\)
  subunits chosen from the \(6\) mutant and \(14\) normal units. Cell \(2\)
  gets the rest. What is the probability that one of the cells consists of
  all normal subunits.

  Mrs.\@ Jones predicts that if it rains tomorrow it is bound to rain the
  day after tomorrow. She also thinks that the chance of rain tomorrow is
  \(1/2\) and that the chance of rain the day after tomorrow is
  \(1/3\). Are these subjective probabilities consistent with the axioms
