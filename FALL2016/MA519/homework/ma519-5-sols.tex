  Find the variance of the following random variables
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item[(d)] \(X=\#\) of tosses of a fair coin necessary to obtain a head
    for the first time.
  \item[(f)] \(X=\#\) matches observed in random sitting of \(4\) husbands
    and their wives in opposite sides of a linear table.

    This is an example of the \emph{matching problem.}

  either successes or failures) started by the first trial.

\begin{problem}[Handout 7, \# 17]
  A man with \(n\) keys wants to open his door and tries the keys
  independently and at random. Find the mean and variance of the number of
  trials
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item[(a)] if unsuccessful keys are not eliminated from further
    selections;
  \item[(b)] if they are.
  \end{itemize}

  given in II, 7, but are not required for the present problem.)
