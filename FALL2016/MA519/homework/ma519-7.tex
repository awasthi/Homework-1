\begin{problem}[Handout 10, \# 4]
  \emph{(Poisson Approximation.)} One hundred people will each toss a fair
  coin \(200\) times. Approximate the probability that at least \(10\) of
  the \(100\) people would each have obtained exactly \(100\) heads and
  \(100\) tails.
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
  Let \(X\) denote the number of people who obtain exactly \(100\) heads
  and (consequently) \(100\) tails. First, we compute the probability that
  any one given person obtains exactly \(100\) heads. There are \(2^{200}\)
  possible outcomes for \(200\) tosses of a fair coin, and
  \(\binom{200}{100}\) possible ways of obtaining exactly \(100\)
  heads. Thus, the probability that any one person obtains exactly \(100\)
  head in \(200\) tosses of a fair coin is
  \[
    p=\frac{\binom{200}{100}}{2^{200}}\approx\num{0.05634847900925642}.
  \]

  Now, assuming \(X\sim\Poisson(\num{5.634847900925642})\), the
  probability that at least \(10\) of the \(100\) people have each obtained
  exactly \(100\) heads and \(100\) tails is
  \begin{align*}
    P(X\geq 10)
    &=1-P(X<10)\\
    &=1-\sum_{i=1}^9 P(X=i)\\
    &=1
      -e^{-\num{5.634847900925642}}
      \sum_{i=0}^9\frac{\num{5.634847900925642}^i}{i!}\\
    &=1-\num{0.8825634032515405}\\
    &\approx \num{0.11743659674845952}.
  \end{align*}

\begin{problem}[Handout 10, \# 5]
  \emph{(A Pretty Question.)} Suppose \(X\) is a Poisson distributed random
  variable. Can three different values of \(X\) have an equal probability?
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
  No. Let \(X\sim\Poisson(\lambda)\). First, we show that given any two
  values \(k_1,k_2\in\bbZ_{\geq 0}\), there exists \(\lambda\) such that
  \(p(k_1)=p(k_2)\).

  Observe that for \(p(k_1)=p(k_2)\) we must have
  \begin{align*}
    e^{-\lambda}\frac{\lambda^{k_1}}{k_1!}
    &=e^{-\lambda}\frac{\lambda^{k_2}}{k_2!}\\
    \lambda^{k_1-k_2}
    &=\frac{k_1!}{k_2!}
      \intertext{this implies that, given \(k_1\) and \(k_2\),}
      (k_1-k_2)\ln\lambda&=\ln(k_1!/k_2!)\\
    \lambda(k_1,k_2)&=e^{\ln(k_1!/k_2!)/(k_1-k_2)}.
  \end{align*}
  For example, \(\lambda(3,5)\approx\num{4.472135954999579}\) and
  \[
    p(3)\approx\num{0.17028240507308132}\approx p(5).
  \]

  We now prove our original claim. Assume for a moment that \(X\) is
  continuous. We will show that the PMF \(p\) of \(X\) has at most one
  critical point. Write the PMF of \(p\) as its continuous analogue
  \[
    p(x)=P(X=x)=\frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^x}{\Gamma(x)}.
  \]
  Then, taking the derivative of \(p\), we have
  \begin{align*}
    p'(x)
    &=e^{-\lambda}\frac{\Gamma(x)\lambda^x\ln\lambda-\lambda^x\Gamma(x)}{\Gamma(x)^2}\\
    &=\frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^x}{\Gamma(x)}
      \left[\ln\lambda-\frac{\Gamma'(x)}{\Gamma(x)}\right]\\
    &=p(x)\left[\ln\lambda-\frac{\Gamma'(x)}{\Gamma(x)}\right].
  \end{align*}
  Since \(\Gamma,\Gamma'>0\) for all \(x\in\bbR_{\geq 0}\), \(p'(x)=0\) if
  and only if
  \[
    \ln\lambda=\frac{\Gamma'(x)}{\Gamma(x)}
  \]
  which happens at most once since the quotient.

\begin{problem}[Handout 10, \# 6]
  \emph{(Poisson Approximation.)} There are \(20\) couples seated at a
  rectangular table, husbands on one side and the wives on the other, in a
  random order. Using a Poisson approximation, find the probability that
  exactly two husbands are seated directly across from their wives; at
  least three are; at most three are.
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
  Let \(X\) count the number of husbands that have been seated directly
  across from their respective wives. We approximate the probabilities that
  (i) exactly two husbands are seated directly across from their wives,
  (ii) at least three are, and (iii) at most three are, by assuming that
  \(X\sim\Poisson(\lambda)\). But first, we compute the probability \(p\)
  that exactly one husband has been seated directly across from his wife.

  There are \(20!\) arrangements for the
  couples. Fixing the husbands, there are \(20\) ways to pick the wife that
  is to be seated directly across from her husband. There remain \(19\)
  couples and we want none of these to be seated right across from each
  other. To this end, and in order to save some time, we use the formula
  for counting \emph{derangements}, which can be derived from the
  inclusion-exclusion principle,
  \begin{align*}
    !19&=19!\sum_{i=0}^n\frac{(-1)^i}{i!}\\
       &=\num{44750731559645100}.
  \end{align*}
  Thus,
  \[
    p=\frac{20(!19)}{20!}=\frac{!19}{19!}\approx\num{0.3678794411714423},
  \]
  so \(\lambda\approx\num{7.357588823428846}\).

  With this, we can proceed to approximate (i) the probability that exactly
  two husbands are seated across from their wives. This is given by
  \[
    p(2)=e^{-\num{7.357588823428846}}\frac{\num{7.357588823428846}^2}{2!}
    \approx\num{0.01726159034832215}
  \]

  \emph{(Poisson Approximation.)} There are \(5\) coins on a desk, with
  probabilities \(0.05\), \(0.1\), \(0.05\), \(0.01\), and \(0.04\) for
  heads. By using a Poisson approximation, find the probability of
  obtaining at least one head when the five coins are each tossed once.

  \noindent Is the number of heads obtained binomially distributed in this
  problem?
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
  First, let us find the probability \(p\) that the toss of a coin randomly
  selected from the \(5\) comes up heads. This is given by
  \[
    p=\frac{0.05+0.1+0.05+0.01+0.04}{5}=0.05.
  \]
  Now, \(\lambda=0.25\) so the probability of obtaining at least one head
  is
  \[
    e^{-0.25}\sum_{i=1}^5 \frac{0.25^i}{i!}\approx\num{0.22119894311503177}.
