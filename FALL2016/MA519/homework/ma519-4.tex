\begin{problem}[Handout 5, \# 2]
  In an urn, there are \(12\) balls. \(4\) of these are white. Three
  players: \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\), take turns drawing a ball from the urn,
  in the alphabetical order. The first player to draw a white ball is the
  winner. Find the respective winning probabilities: assume that at each
  trial, the ball drawn in the trial before is put back into the urn (i.e.,
  selection \emph{with replacement}).

\begin{problem}[Handout 6, \# 7]
  Find a discrete random variable \(X\) such that \(E(X)=E(X^3)=0\);
  \(E(X^2)=E(X^4)=1\).
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
  Set \(\Omega=\{0,1\}\) and define a random variable
  \(X\colon\Omega\to\bfR\) by \(X(0)= -1\), \(X(1)= 1\) as well as a
  probability \(P(0)=P(1)=1/2\). Then
  \[
    E[X]=-1(1/2)+1(1/2)=0=(-1)^3(1/2)+1^3(1/2)=E[X^3],
  \]
  whereas
  \[
    E[X^2]=(-1)^2(1/2)+1^2(1/2)=1=(-1)^4(1/2)+1^4(1/2)=E[X^4],
  \]
  as desired.

\begin{problem}[Handout 6, \# 9]
  \emph{(Runs).} Suppose a fair die is rolled \(n\) times. By using the
  indicator variable method, find the expected number of times that a six
  is followed by at least two other sixes. Now compute the value when
  \(n=100\).
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
  Write \(\Omega\) as the union events
  \[
    Ak=\bigl\{\,\text{roll of the die comes up \(n\)}\,\bigr\},%
    \quad%
    1\leq k\leq 6.
  \]
  Note that the \(Ak\) are not necessarily disjoint events. Now, define a
  random variable \(X\colon\Omega\to\bfR\) by setting
  \(X(\omega)=\sum_{n=1}^6\chi_{Ak}(x)\) where \(\chi_{Ak}(x)=1\) if
  \(x\in Ak\), and \(\chi_{Ak}(x)=0\) otherwise.

  Assuming every sample point is equally likely,
  \[
    P(\omega)=\frac{1}{\#\Omega}=\frac{1}{6^n}
  \]
  for every \(\omega\in\Omega\). Thus

  \emph{(The blood-testing problem).} A large number, \(N\), of people are
  subject to a blood test. This can be administered in two ways, (i) Each
  person can be tested separately. In this case \(N\) tests are required,
  (ii) The blood samples of \(k\) people can be pooled and analyzed
  together. If the test is negative, this one test suffices for the \(k\)
  people. If the test is positive, each of the \(k\) persons must be tested
  separately, and in all \(k+1\) tests are required for the \(k\)
  people. Assume the probability \(p\) that the test is positive is the
  same for all people and that people are stochastically independent.
