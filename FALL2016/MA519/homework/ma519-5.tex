\begin{problem}[Handout 7, \# 6(d, f)]
  Find the variance of the following random variables
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item[(d)] \(X=\#\) of tosses of a fair coin necessary to obtain a head
    for the first time.
  \item[(f)] \(X=\#\) matches observed in random sitting of \(4\) husbands
    and their wives in opposite sides of a linear table.

    This is an example of the \emph{matching problem.}
  \end{itemize}
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
  For part (d), let \(\Omega\) denote the sample space and let \(A_n\)
  denote the event ``it takes \(n\) tosses of a coin to obtain a head for
  the first time.''

\newpage

% For part (d), let \(A_n\) denote the event ``it takes \(n\) tosses of a
% fair coin to obtain a head for the first time.'' Note that the \(A_n\)
% form a disjoint sequence of events and that
% \(\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty A_n=\Omega\). Using this fact, we can compute the
% mean
% \[
%   \mu=\sum_{n=1}^\infty n\left(\frac{1}{2^n}\right).
% \]
% But what is the value of \(\mu\) explicitly?

% Consider the series
% \[
%   \sum_{n=1}^\infty n x^n=x\left[\sum_{n=1}^\infty nx^{n-1}\right].
% \]
% Set \(f(x)\defeq\sum_{n=1}^\infty nx^{n-1}\). Then, with a little
% calculus, we have
% \[
%   \int f\diff x=\sum_{n=1}^\infty x^n =-1+\sum_{n=0}^\infty
%   x^n=-1+\frac{1}{1-x} =\frac{x}{1-x},
% \]
% so
% \[
%   f(x)=\frac{d}{dx}\left[\frac{x}{1-x}\right]=\frac{1}{(1-x)^2}.
% \]
% Now we can obtain the mean by evaluating \(xf(x)\) at \(1/2\),
% \[
%   \mu=(1/2)f(1/2)=\frac{(1/2)}{\bigl(1-(1/2)\bigr)^2}=
%   \frac{(1/2)}{(1/2)^2}=\frac{1}{2}=0.5
% \]

% By the proposition in DasGupta's book,
% \[
%   \Var(X)=E(X^2)-\mu^2,
% \]
% so the only thing we need to compute is the expectation \(E(X^2)\). This
% is given by the series
% \[
%   E(X^2)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty n^2\left(\frac{1}{2^n}\right).
% \]
% This can also be computed in a similar fashion, yielding
% \[
%   E(X^2)=12.
% \]
% Thus,
% \[
%   \Var(X)=12-0.5=11.5.
% \]
