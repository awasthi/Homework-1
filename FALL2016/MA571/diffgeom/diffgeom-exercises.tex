\chapter{Differential Geometry Review}
Review exercises for differential geometry taken from Lee's book on Smooth
Manifolds.
\section{Smooth Manifolds}
Let's get the basics down first. Here is what we need to know.
\subsection{Topological Manifolds}
Suppose \(M\) is a topological space. We say that \(M\) is a
\emph{topological manifold of dimension \(n\)} or a \emph{topological
  \(n\)-manifold} if it has the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \(M\) is a \emph{Hausdorff space}: for every pair of distinct points
  \(p,q\in M\), there are disjoint open subset \(U,V\subseteq M\) such that
  \(p\in U\), \(q\in V\).
\item \(M\) is \emph{second-countable}: there exists a countable basis for
  the topology of \(M\).
\item \(M\) is \emph{locally Euclidean of dimension \(n\)}: each point of
  \(M\) has
\end{enumerate}
