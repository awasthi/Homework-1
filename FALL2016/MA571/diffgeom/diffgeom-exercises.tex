\chapter{Differential Geometry Review}
Review exercises for differential geometry taken from Fernandes's notes
from UIUC's differential geometry course.

\subsection{Manifolds and subsets of Euclidean spaces}
\begin{proposition}
  Let \(X\subseteq\bbR^n\), \(Y\subseteq\bbR^m\) and
  \(Z\subseteq\bbR^p\). If \(f\colon X\to Y\) and \(g\colon Y\to Z\) are
  smooth maps, then \(g\circ f\colon X\to Z\) is also a smooth map.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  The proof of this is rather simple. Suppose that \(f\colon X\to Y\) and
  \(g\colon Y\to Z\) are smooth. Then its partial derivatives of every
  order exist and are continuous, i.e.,
  \begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial^{i_1+\dotsb+i_r}f^j}{\partial x^{i_1}\dotsm\partial
    x^{i_r}}(x)\\
     \frac{\partial^{i_1+\dotsb+i_r}g^j}{\partial x^{i_1}\dotsm\partial
    x^{i_r}}(x)
  \end{align*}
\end{proof}
