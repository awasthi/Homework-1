\subsection{Homework 1}
\begin{exercise}
  Let \(\{X_i:i\in I\}\) be an \(I\)-indexed family of topological
  spaces. Show that the Cartesian product
  \[
    X=\prod_{i\in I} X_i,
  \]
  equipped with the product topology, has the property that for each
  \(i\in I\) the projection \(\pi_i\colon X\to X_i\) is continuous, and
  moreover, that \(X\) has the following universal property: for any other
  topological space \(Y\), the function
  \[
    \Hom_{\Topo}(Y,X)\too\prod_{i\in I}\Hom_{\Topo}(Y,X_i),
  \]
  induced by the projections \(p_i\colon X\to X_i\), is a bijection.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
  Let \(X\) be the set equipped with a topology and let
  \(\{\calU_i:i\in I\}\) a family of topologies on \(X\). Show that
  \[
    \calU=\bigcap_{i\in I}\calU_i
  \]
  is a topology on \(X\). Show that if \(\calB\) is a basis for a topology
  on \(X\), then the topology \(\calU\) on \(X\) generated by \(\calB\) is
  the intersection of all topologies on \(X\) which contain \(\calB\), and
  that this holds even if we only require that \(\calB\) be a subbasis.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
  A topological space \(X\) is said to be \emph{Hausdorff} if, for every
  pair of points \(x_0,x_1\in X\) with \(x_0\neq x_1\), there exists open
  subsets \(U_0\), \(U_1\) of \(X\) such that \(x_0\ni U_0\),
  \(x_1\in U_1\), and \(U_0\cap U_1=\emptyset\). Show that a topological
  space \(X\) is Hausdorff if and only if the diagonal inclusion
  \(X\to X\times X\) is closed.
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}
\end{solution}

\begin{exercise}
  Let \(X\) be a topological space and let \(Y\subseteq X\) be a subset of
  \(X\). Show that if \(Y\) is equipped with the subspace topology then the
  inclusion function \(\iota\colon Y\to X\) is continuous. Show that if
  there exists a continuous function \(q\colon X\to Y\) such that
  \(q\circ\iota=\id_Y\) then \(q\) is a quotient map (that is, \(Y\) is also
  a quotient topology). Give an example of such a situation.
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}
\end{solution}

\begin{exercise}
  A \emph{topological group} is a group \(G\) with a topology \(\calU\)
  such that the multiplication \(\mu\colon G\times G\to G\) and inversion
  \(\iota\colon G\to G\) are continuous (it is standard to also assume that
  the topology \(\calU\) on \(G\) is Hausdorff, which we shall do). Let
  \(H\) be a subgroup of \(G\), and let \(G/H\) denote the quotient of
  \(G\) by the action of \(H\), equipped with the quotient topology. Show
  that \(G/H\) is a homogeneous space and that the quotient map \(q\colon
  G\to G/H\) is open. If, moreover, \(H\) is a closed subset of \(G\), show
  that \(G/H\) has the property that points are closed. Finally, show that
  if \(H\) is a normal subgroup of \(G\), then \(G/H\) is a topological
  group. (Optional: is it Hausdorff?)
