\begin{problem}
  Verify assertion (36) in [E, \S 3.2.3], that when \(\Gamma\) is not flat
  near \(x^0\) the noncharacteristic condition is D p F (p 0 , z 0 , x 0 )
  · ν(x 0 ) 6 = 0.  (Here ν(x 0 ) denotes the normal to the hypersurface Γ
  at x 0 ).

  2. Show that the solution of the quasilinear PDE u t + a(u)u x = 0 with
  initial conditions u(x, 0) = g(x) is given implicitly by u = g(x −
  a(u)t).  Show that the solution develops a shock (becomes singular) for
  some t > 0, unless a(g(x)) is a nondecreasing function of x.
