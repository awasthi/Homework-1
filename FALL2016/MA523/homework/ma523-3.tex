\begin{problem}
  Consider the initial value problem
  \[
    u_t=\sin u_x;\qquad u(x,0)=\frac{\pi}{4}x.
  \]
  Verify that the assumptions of the Cauchy--Kovalevskaya theorem are
  satisfied and obtain the Taylor series of the solution about the origin.
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
  The initial value problem certainly satisfies the assumptions of the
  Cauchy--Kovalevskaya theorem: setting \(\bfu=(u,u_x,u_t,t)\), the
  \(\bfB\) are all identically \(0\) and \(\bfc(\bfu,x)=\sin u_x(x,t)\) is
  analytic. Next we show that he Taylor series of \(u\) at \((0,0)\),
  \[
    \tilde u(x,t)=\sum_{(\alpha_1,\alpha_2)}
    \frac{u_{\alpha_1,\alpha_2}(0)}{\alpha_1!\alpha_2!} x^{\alpha_1}t^{\alpha_2},
  \]
  is a solution to our PDE.

  First, we must compute the coefficients
  \[
    \frac{u_{\alpha_1,\alpha_2}(0,0)}{\alpha_1!\alpha_2!}.
  \]
  To this end, we must find the partial derivatives
  \(u_{\alpha_1,\alpha_2}\) and potentially, relations among them which
  will help us to find these coefficients. Na√Øvely listing the partials
  with respect to \(t\) and \(x\), we have
  \begin{align*}
    u(0,0)&=0\\
    u_x(0,0)&=\frac{\pi}{4}\\
    u_t(0,0)&=\sin u_x(0,0)=\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\\
    u_{xx}(0,0)&=0\\
    u_{tx}(0,0)&=0\\
    u_{tt}(0,0)&=-\cos\bigl(u_x(0,0)\bigr)u_{xt}(0,0)=0\\
    u_{xxx}(0,0)&=0\\
    u_{ttx}(0,0)&=0,
  \end{align*}
  etc. Thus,
  \[
    \tilde u=\frac{\pi}{4}x+\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}t.
  \]
  Plugging this equation into our PDE, we have
  \[
    \tilde u_t-\sin\tilde u_x=\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}-\sin(\pi/4)=0,
  \]
  as desired.
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}
  Consider the Cauchy problem for \(u(x,y)\)
  \begin{align*}
    u_y&=a(x, y, u)u_x+b(x,y,u)\\
    u(x,0)&=0
  \end{align*}
  Let \(a\) and \(b\) be analytic functions of their arguments. Assume that
  \(D^\alpha a(0,0,0)\geq 0\) and \(D^\alpha b(0,0,0)\geq 0\) for all
  \(\alpha\). (Remember by definition, if \(\alpha=0\) then
  \(D^\alpha f=f\).)
  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*),noitemsep]
  \item Show that \(D^\beta u(0,0)\geq 0\) for all \(|\beta|\leq 2\).
  \item Prove that \(D^\beta u(0,0)\geq 0\) for all
    \(\beta=(\beta_1,\beta_2)\). (\emph{Hint:} Argue as in the proof of the
    Cauchy--Kovalevskaya theorem; i.e., use induction in \(\beta_2\))
  \end{enumerate}
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
  Write
  \[
    a(x,y,u)=\sum_{\beta_1,\beta_2,\alpha}
    a_{\alpha,\beta_1,\beta_2}x^{\beta_1}y^{\beta_2}u^\alpha,\qquad
    b(x,y,u)=\sum_{\beta_1,\beta_2,\alpha}
    b_{\alpha,\beta_1,\beta_2}x^{\beta_1}y^{\beta_2}u^\alpha.
  \]

  For part (a) we show this explicitly by considering all cases. The case
  \(\beta=(0,0)\) is obvious as are the cases \(\beta=(0,1)\) and
  \(\beta=(1,0)\) since \(u_x(0,0)=0\) and
  \begin{align*}
    u_y(0,0)
    &=a\bigl(0,0,u(0,0)\bigr)u_x(0,0)+b\bigl( 0,0,u(0,0) \bigr)\\
    &=a(0,0,0)u_x(0,0)+b(0,0,0)\\
    &=b(0,0,0)\\
    &\geq 0
  \end{align*}
  since \(b\) is a series of strictly positive numbers. For
  \(\beta=(2,0)\), we have \(u_{xx}(0,0)=0\). For \(\beta=(1,1)\), we have
  \begin{align*}
    u_{xy}(0,0)&=a\bigl(0,0,u(0,0)\bigr)u_{xx}(0,0)+\frac{\partial}{\partial
                 x}a\bigl( 0,0,u(0,0) \bigr)u_x(0,0)
                 +\frac{\partial}{\partial x} b\bigl(0,0,u(0,0)\bigr)\\
               &=\frac{\partial}{\partial x} b(0,0,0)\\
               &\geq 0.
  \end{align*}
  For \(\beta=(0,2)\), we have
  \begin{align*}
    u_{yy}(0,0)&=a\bigl(0,0,u(0,0)\bigr)u_{xy}(0,0)+\frac{\partial}{\partial
                 y}a\bigl( 0,0,u(0,0) \bigr)u_x(0,0)
                 +\frac{\partial}{\partial y} b\bigl(0,0,u(0,0)\bigr)\\
               &=a(0,0,0)\frac{\partial}{\partial
                 y}b(0,0,0)+\frac{\partial}{\partial y}b(0,0,0)\\
               &\geq 0
  \end{align*}
  since the latter is a sum of positive numbers.

  For part (b):

\begin{problem}
  (Kovalevskaya's example) Show that the line \(\{t=0\}\) is characteristic
  for the heat equation \(u_t=u_{xx}\). Show there does not exist an
  analytic solution \(\) of the heat equation in \(\bfR\times\bfR\), with
  \(u=1/(1+x^2)\) on \(\{t=0\}\). (\emph{Hint:} Assume there is an analytic
  solution, compute its coefficients, and show instead that the resulting
  power series diverges in any neighborhood of \((0,0)\).)
