\begin{problem}
  Consider the initial value problem
  \[
    u_t=\sin u_x;\qquad u(x,0)=\frac{\pi}{4}x.
  \]
  Verify that the assumptions of the Cauchy--Kovalevskaya theorem are
  satisfied and obtain the Taylor series of the solution about the origin.

  Write \(\bfu\defeq(u,u_x,u_t)=(u,u_x,\sin u_x)\). First, let us note that

\begin{problem}
  Consider the Cauchy problem for \(u(x,y)\)
  \begin{align*}
    u_y&=a(x, y, u)u_x+b(x,y,u)\\
    u(x,0)&=0
  \end{align*}
  Let \(a\) and \(b\) be analytic functions of their arguments. Assume that
  \(D^\alpha a(0,0,0)\geq 0\) and \(D^\alpha b(0,0,0)\geq 0\) for all
  \(\alpha\). (Remember by definition, if \(\alpha=0\) then
  \(D^\alpha f=f\).)
  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*),noitemsep]
  \item Show that \(D^\beta u(0,0)\geq 0\) for all \(|\beta|\leq 2\).
  \item Prove that \(D^\beta u(0,0)\geq 0\) for all
    \(\beta=(\beta_1,\beta_2)\). (\emph{Hint:} Argue as in the proof of the
    Cauchy--Kovalevskaya theorem; i.e., use induction in \(\beta_2\))

\begin{problem}
  (Kovalevskaya's example) Show that the line \(\{t=0\}\) is characteristic
  for the heat equation \(u_t=u_{xx}\). Show there does not exist an
  analytic solution \(\) of the heat equation in \(\bfR\times\bfR\), with
  \(u=1/(1+x^2)\) on \(\{t=0\}\). (\emph{Hint:} Assume there is an analytic
  solution, compute its coefficients, and show that the resulting power
  series diverges in any neighborhood of \((0,0)\).)
