\subsection{Homework 2}
\begin{problem}
  Verify assertion (36) in [E, \S 3.2.3], that when \(\Gamma\) is not flat
  near \(x^0\) the noncharacteristic condition is
  \[
    D_pF(p^0,z^0,x^0)\cdot \nu(x^0)\neq 0.
  \]
  (Here \(\nu(x^0)\) denotes the normal to the hypersurface \(\Gamma\) at
  \(x^0\)).
\end{problem}
\begin{solution*}
  First, note that the condition
  \[
    D_pF(p^0,z^0,x^0)\cdot \nu(x^0)\neq 0
  \]
  reduces to the standard noncharacteristic boundary condition if
  \(\Gamma\) is flat near \(x^0\) since in that case the normal to the
  hypersurface at \(x^0\) will be \((0,\dotsc,0,1)\); i.e.,
  \begin{align*}
    0&\neq D_pF(p^0,z^0,x^0)\cdot (0,\dotsc,0,1)\\
     &=F_{p_n}(p^0,z^0,x^0).
  \end{align*}
  We shall therefore proceed to flatten the hypersurface \(\Gamma\) near
  \(x^0\) and apply the standard noncharacteristic boundary condition.

  Assuming \(\Gamma\) is reasonably tame, by the implicit function theorem,
  it can be written as the graph \(x_n=\phi(x_1,\dotsc,x_{n-1})\) on some
  neighborhood \(U\) of \(x^0\). Now consider the map \(\Phi\colon U\to V\)
  given by
  \[
    \left\{
      \begin{aligned}
        y_j&=\Phi^j(x)=x_j,\qquad 1\leq j\leq n-1,\\
        y_n&=\Phi^n(x)=x_n-\phi(x_1,\dotsc,x_{n-1}).
      \end{aligned}
    \right.
  \]
  Then the normal \(\nu\) to \(\Gamma\) at \(x^0\) is parallel to the
  gradient \(D_x\Phi^n=(-\phi_{x_1},\dotsc,-\phi_{x_{n-1}},1)\).

  Now define \(v(y)\defeq u(\Phi^{-1}(y))\). Then \(u(x)=v(\Phi(x))\). By
  the chain rule, we have
  \[
    D_{x_i}u=\sum_{j=1}^n D_{y_j} vD_{x_j}\Phi^j,\quad 1\leq j\leq n;
  \]
  i.e., \(D_x u=D_y v D_x\Phi\). Now the PDE \(F(D_xu,u,x)\) becomes
  \[
    \tilde F(D_yv, v, y)=F(D_y vD_x\Phi,v,\Phi^{-1}(y))=0.
  \]
  Lastly, we have
  \begin{align*}
    D_{p_n}\tilde F
    &=(D_{p_1}F)(D_{x_1}\Phi^n)+\dotsb+(D_{p_n}F)(D_{x_n}\Phi)\\
    &=D_pF\cdot D_x\Phi^n.
  \end{align*}
  Therefore, if \((p^0,z^0,x^0)\) is a compatible triple for \(F\) and
  \((q^0,z^0,y^0)=(p^0D_x\Phi(x^0),z^0,\Phi(x^0))\) is the
  corresponding for \(\tilde F\), then
  \[
    D_{p_n}\tilde F(q^0,z^0,y^0)=D_pF(p^0,z^0,x^0)\cdot D_x\Phi^n(x^0).
  \]
  Hence, the noncharacteristic condition becomes
  \[
    D_p F(p^0,z^0,x^0)\cdot D_x\Phi^n(x^0)\neq 0;
  \]
  i.e.,
  \[
    D_p F(p^0,z^0,x^0)\cdot\nu(x^0)\neq 0
  \]
  where \(\nu(x^0)\) is the normal vector to \(\Gamma\) at \(x^0\).

\begin{problem}
  Show that the function \(u(x,t)\) defined for \(t\geq 0\) by

      -\tfrac{2}{3}\Bigl(t+\sqrt{3x+t^2}\Bigr)
      &\text{for \(4x+t^2>0\)}\\
      0
      &\text{for \(4x+t^2<0\)}
    \end{cases}
  \]
  is an (unbounded) entropy solution of the conservation law
  \(u_t+(u^2/2)_x=0\) (\emph{inviscid Burgers' equation}).
