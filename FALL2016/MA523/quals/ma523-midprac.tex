\begin{problem}
  Solve \(u_{x_1}^2+x_2u_{x_2}=u\) with initial conditions
  \(u(x,1)=x^2/4+1\).
\end{problem}
\begin{solution*}
  Assuming \(u(x,1)=x^2/4+1\) was meant to be written
  \(u(x_1,1)=x_1^2/4+1\), an obvious candidate for the solution is
  \[
    \hat u(x_1,x_2)\defeq\frac{x_1^2}{4}+x_2.
  \]
  First, note that \(u\) does in fact solve the PDE,
  \begin{align*}
    \hat u_{x_1}^2+x_2\hat u_{x_2}
    &=\left(\frac{x_1^2}{4}+x_2\right)_{x_1}^2
    +x_2\left(\frac{x_1^2}{4}+x_2\right)_{x_2}\\
    &=\left(\frac{x_1}{2}\right)^2+x_2\\
    &=\frac{x_1^2}{4}+x_2\\
    &=\hat u.
  \end{align*}
  It is clear that \(\hat u\) satisfies the conditions at \(x_2=1\).
\end{solution*}

\begin{problem}
  Find the maximal \(t_0>0\) for which the (classical) solution of the
  Cauchy problem
  \[
    \left\{
      \begin{aligned}
        uu_x+u_t&=0,\\
        u(x,0)&=e^{-x^2/2},
      \end{aligned}
    \right.
  \]
  exists in \(\bbR\times[0,t)\); i.e., the first time \(t=t_0\) when the
  shock develops.
\end{problem}
\begin{solution*}
  The equation is linear, so the method of characteristics applies
  here. Set \(\dot x\defeq u\), \(\dot t\defeq 1\), and \(\dot z\defeq
  0\). Thus, \(z=C\) for some constant \(C\in\bbR\) and
  \begin{align*}
    x(s)
    &=\int_0^s C\diff\tau\\
    &=Cs,\\
    t&=s-0.
  \end{align*}
\end{solution*}

\begin{problem}
  If \(\rho_0\) denotes the maximum density of cars on a highway (i.e.,
  under bumpet-to-bumper conditions), then a reasonable model for traffic
  density \(\rho\) is given by
  \[
     \left\{
       \begin{aligned}
         \rho_t+(F(\rho))_x&=0,\\
         F(\rho)&=cp\left(1-\frac{\rho}{\rho_0}\right),
      \end{aligned}
    \right.
  \]
  where \(c>0\) is a constant (free speed of highway). Suppose the initial
  density is
  \[
    \rho(x,0)=
    \begin{cases}
      \frac{1}{2}\rho_0&\text{if \(x<0\),}\\
      \rho_0&\text{if \(x>0\).}
    \end{cases}
  \]

  result for the traffic flow.)
