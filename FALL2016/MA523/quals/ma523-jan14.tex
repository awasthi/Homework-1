  \]
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item[(a)] Find the characteristic curves of the equation.

    neighborhood of the point \((1,0)\).

\begin{problem}
  Let \(u\) be a continuous bounded solution of the initial value problem
  for the Laplace equation

  \[
    \left\{
      \begin{aligned}
        \Lap u&=0&&\text{in \(\{\,x_n>0\,\}\),}\\
        u(x',0)&=g(x')&&\text{for \(x'\in\bbR^{n-1}\),}
      \end{aligned}
    \right.
  \]
  where \(g\) is a continuous function with compact support in
  \(\bbR^{n-1}\). Here \(n\geq 2\). Prove that
  \[
    u(x)\To 0,\qquad%
    \text{as } |x|\To \infty,
  \]
  for \(x\in\{\,x_n>0\,\}\).

\begin{problem}
  Let \(u\) be a bounded solution of the heat equation
  \[
    \Lap u-u_t=0\qquad\text{in \(\bbR\times(0,\infty)\),}
  \]
  with the initial conditions \(u(x,0)=g(x)\), where \(g\) is a bounded
  continuous function on \(\bbR\) satisfying the HÃ¶lder condition
  \[
    |g(x)-g(y)|\leq M|x-y|^\alpha,\qquad x,y\in\bbR
  \]
  with a constant \(\alpha\in (0, 1]\). Show that
  \[
    \begin{aligned}
      |u(x,t)-u(y,t)|&\leq M|x-y|^\alpha,&&x,y\in\bbR,t>0,\\
      |u(x,t)-u(x,s)|&\leq C_\alpha M|t-s|^{\alpha/2},&&x\in\bbR,t,s>0.
    \end{aligned}
  \]

  \noindent [\emph{Hint:} For the last inequality, in the representation
  formula of \(u(x,t)\) as a convolution with the heat kernel
  \(\Phi(y,t)\), make a change of variables \(z=y/\sqrt{t}\) and use that
  $\left|\sqrt{t}-\sqrt{s}\right|\leq\sqrt{|t-s|}$.]

\begin{problem}
  Let \(u\) be a positive harmonic function in the unit ball \(B_1\) in
  \(\bbR^n\). Show that
  \[
    \bigl|D(\ln u)\bigr|\leq M\qquad \text{in \(B_{1/2}\)}
  \]
  for a constant \(M\) depending only on the dimension \(n\).

  \noindent [\emph{Hint:} Use the interior derivative estimate
  \(\bigl|Du(x)\bigr|\leq(C_n/r)\sup_{B_r(x)}|u|\) for
  \(B_r(x)\subset B_1\) as well as the Harnack inequality for harmonic
  functions.]
\end{problem}
\begin{solution*}
\end{solution*}

\begin{problem}
  Let \(u\) be a \(C^2\) solution of the initial value problem
  \[
    \left\{
    \begin{aligned}
      u_{tt}-\Lap u&=|x|^k&&&&\text{in \(\bbR^n\times(0,\infty)\),}\\
      u&=0,&u_t&=0&&\text{on \(\bbR^n\times\{0\}\)}.
    \end{aligned}
    \right.
  \]
  for some \(k\geq 0\). Prove that there exists a function \(\phi(r)\)
  such that
  \[
    u(x,t)=t^{k+2}\phi\bigl(|x|/t\bigr).
  \]

  \noindent [\emph{Hint:} As one of the steps show that \(u\) is
  \((k+2)\)-homogeneous in \((x,t)\) variables, i.e.,
  \(u(\lambda x,\lambda t)=\lambda^{k+2}u(x,t)\) for any \(\lambda >0\).]
