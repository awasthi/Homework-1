\chapter{Prologue}
This summer, we will be making our way through Knapp's \emph{Lie Groups
  Beyond an Introduction} \cite{knapp} although, I (the writer of these
notes) will occasionally refer to \cite{hall} for examples.


\section{Lie Algebras and Lie Groups}
\subsection{Definitions and Examples}
Let $\bbk$ be a field. An \emph{algebra $\frakg$} (not necessarily
associative) is a vector space over $\bbk$ with product $[X,Y]$ that is
linear in each variable. The algebra is a \emph{Lie algebra} if the product
satisfies also
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*),noitemsep]
\item $[X,X]=0$ for all $X\in\frakg$ (and hence, $[X,Y]=-[Y,X]$) and
\item the \emph{Jacobi identity}
\[
[[X,Y],Z]+[[Y,Z],X]+[[Z,X],Y]=0.
\]
\end{enumerate}

For any algebra $\frakg$ we get a linear map
$\ad\colon\frakg\to\End_\bbk\frakg$ given by
\[
(\ad X)(Y)\coloneqq[X,Y].
\]
The fact that the image is in $\End_\bbk\frakg$ follows from the linearity
of the bracket in the second variable and the fact that $\ad$ is linear
follows from the linearity of bracket in the first variable. Whenever there
is possible ambiguity in what the underlying vector space is, we write
$\ad_\frakg X$ in place of $\ad X$.

Suppose that (a) holds in the definition of Lie algebra. Then (b) holds if
and only if
\[
[Z,[X,Y]]=[X,[Z,Y]]+[[Z,X],Y]
\]
which holds if and only if
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:1:1}
(\ad Z)[X,Y]=[X,(\ad Z)Y]+[(\ad Z)X,Y].
\end{equation}

Any $D$ in $\End_\bbk\frakg$ for which
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:1:2}
  D[X,Y]=[X,DY]+[DX,Y]
\end{equation}
is called a \emph{derivation}.
