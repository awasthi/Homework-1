  satisfy in order to be a vector space.

  \question Which of the following subsets $W$ of $\bbR^3$ are subspaces?
  \begin{parts}
    \part[2]
    $\displaystyle W=
    \left\{\,\left[\begin{smallmatrix}x\\y\\z\end{smallmatrix}\right]:x\leq y\leq
      z\,\right\}$.
    \part[2]
    $\displaystyle W=
    \left\{\,\left[\begin{smallmatrix}x\\y\\z\end{smallmatrix}\right]:x+y+z=0\,\right\}$.
    \part[2]
    $\displaystyle W=
    \left\{\,\left[\begin{smallmatrix}x\\y\\z\end{smallmatrix}\right]:x^2+y^2+z^2=1\,\right\}$.
    \part[2]
    $\displaystyle W=
    \left\{\,\left[\begin{smallmatrix}x+2y+3z\\z\\0\end{smallmatrix}\right]:x,y,z\in\bbR\,\right\}$.
  \end{parts}
  (By now you should have a feel of what a vector spaces is so you do not
  need to check all of the conditions; but for those that are not
  subspaces, give me a reason, e.g., the set is not closed under addition,
  multiplication by scalars, etc.)
