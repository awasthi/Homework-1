  \question In the following question, $V$ is a finite dimensional vector
  space, $W$ is a subspace of $V$ and $T\colon V\to V$ is a linear operator
  (i.e., a linear map for $V$ into itself).
  \begin{parts}
    \part[2] What does it mean for a set $\{\bfv_1,\ldots,\bfv_n\}$ to be a
    basis for $V$?
    \part[2] What is the meaning of $\dim V$?
    \part[2] What is an eigenvalue of $T$? What is an eigenvector?
    \part[2] When is a linear operator $T$ diagonalizable?
    \part[2] If $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $T$ with respect to $W$, is
    $\lambda$ an eigenvalue of $T$ with respect to $V$?

  \question[4] Suppose that $A$ is a unitary matrix, i.e., $AA^*=I$. ($A^*$
  is the conjugate transpose of $A$, i.e., $A^*={\bar A}^\rmT$) Show that
  the only possible eigenvalues of $A$ are \question[4] Suppose that $A$
  and $B$ are conjugate matrices. Show that if $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue
  of $A$ then it is an eigenvalue of $B$.
