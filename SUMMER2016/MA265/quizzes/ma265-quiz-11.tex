  \question[4] Suppose that $A$ and $B$ are conjugate matrices. Show that
  if $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $A$ then it is an eigenvalue of $B$.
  %
  \begin{solution}
    Suppose that $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $A$ and that $A$ is
    conjugate to $B$. Then, $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $A$ means that
    there exists a vector (the associated eigenvector) $\bfx$ such that
    $A\bfx=\lambda\bfx$; while $A$ is conjugate to $B$ means that there
    exists an invertible matrix $P$ such that $A=PBP^{-1}$. Thus,
    \[
      PBP^{-1}\bfx=A\bfx=\lambda\bfx
    \]
    so
    \begin{align*}
      PBP^{-1}\bfx
      &=\lambda\bfx\\
      BP^{-1}\bfx&=P^{-1}\lambda\bfx\\
      &=\lambda P^{-1}\bfx\\
      \intertext{now let $\bfy=P^{-1}\bfx$ and we have}
      B\bfy&=\lambda\bfy.
    \end{align*}
    So $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $B$ with associated eigenvector
    $\bfy=P^{-1}\bfx$.
  \end{solution}

  \question[8] Suppose that $P$ is an idempotent matrix, i.e., $P^2=I$. Show
  that the only possible eigenvalues for $P$ are $\lambda=0$ and $\lambda=1$.
