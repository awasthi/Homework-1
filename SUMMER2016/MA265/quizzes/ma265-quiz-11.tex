  \question In the following question, $V$ is a finite dimensional vector
  space, $W$ is a subspace of $V$ and $T\colon V\to V$ is a linear operator
  (i.e., a linear map for $V$ into itself).
  \begin{parts}
    \part[2] What does it mean for a set $\{\bfv_1,\ldots,\bfv_n\}$ to be a
    basis for $V$?
    \part[2] What is the meaning of $\dim V$?
    \part[2] What is an eigenvalue of $T$? What is an eigenvector?
    \part[2] When is a linear operator $T$ diagonalizable?
    \part[2] If $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $T$ with respect to $W$, is
    $\lambda$ an eigenvalue of $T$ with respect to $V$?

  \question[4] Suppose that $A$ and $B$ are conjugate matrices. Show that
  if $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $A$ then it is an eigenvalue of $B$.
  %
  \begin{solution}
    Suppose that $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $A$ and that $A$ is
    conjugate to $B$. Then, $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $A$ means that
    there exists a vector (the associated eigenvector) $\bfx$ such that
    $A\bfx=\lambda\bfx$; while $A$ is conjugate to $B$ means that there
    exists an invertible matrix $P$ such that $A=PBP^{-1}$. Thus,
    \[
      PBP^{-1}\bfx=A\bfx=\lambda\bfx
    \]
    so
    \begin{align*}
      PBP^{-1}\bfx
      &=\lambda\bfx\\
      BP^{-1}\bfx&=P^{-1}\lambda\bfx\\
      &=\lambda P^{-1}\bfx\\
      \intertext{now let $\bfy=P^{-1}\bfx$ and we have}
      B\bfy&=\lambda\bfy.
    \end{align*}
    So $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $B$ with associated eigenvector
    $\bfy=P^{-1}\bfx$.
  \end{solution}
  \question[6] Suppose $V$ is a finite dimensional complex vector space
  with an inner product $(\cdot,\cdot)\colon V\times V\to\bbC$. For an
  orthogonal $2\times 2$ matrix $A$, show that
  \[
    (A\bfx,A\bfy)=(\bfx,\bfy)
  \]
  for any $\bfx,\bfy\in V$.
  \begin{solution}
    Since $A$ is an orthogonal matrix, we know that $A{\bar
      A}^\rmT=I$. Now,
    \begin{align*}
      (A\bfx,A\bfy)
      &=(\bfx,{\bar A}^\rmT A\bfy)\\
      &=(\bfx,I\bfy)\\
      &=(\bfx,\bfy)
    \end{align*}
    as desired.
  \end{solution}
