  \question Let $\calP_2(\bbR)$ be the set of all polynomials of degree
  less than or equal to $2$ with coefficients in $\bbR$, i.e., if
  $p(t)=at^2+bt+c$ is a polynomial in $\calP_2(\bbR)$, then $a,b,c\in\bbR$.
  \begin{parts}
    \part[4] Show that the set $\calP_2(\bbR)$ is closed under addition and
    multiplication by scalars. What is a \emph{zero} for this set?
    \bigskip\bigskip\bigskip \bigskip\bigskip\bigskip
    \part[4] The set $\calP_2(\bbR)$ is in fact a vector space. Find a
    basis for $\calP_2(\bbR)$.%
    \bigskip\bigskip\bigskip \bigskip\bigskip\bigskip
    \part[12] Define an inner product $\langle \blank,\blank
    \rangle\colon\calP_2(\bbR)\times\calP_2(\bbR)\to\bbR$ by
    \[
      \langle p(t),q(t) \rangle\longmapsto \int_0^1 p(t)q(t)\diff t.
    \]
    Find a polynomial $q\in\calP_2(\bbR)$ such that
    $\langle p,q \rangle=p(1/2)$ for every $p\in\calP_2(\bbR)$.
    [\textsc{Hint}: You should start by looking at the basis you found in
    part (b). If you chose a nice basis $t^2$ should be in your basis. Now
    for a general $q(t)=at^2+bt+c\in\calP_2(\bbR)$ we have
    \[
      \langle t^2,p(t) \rangle=\int_0^1t^2 q(t)\diff t
      =\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2=\frac{1}{4}.
    \]
    Can you come up with enough equations to solve for the unknowns $a$,
    $b$, $c$?]
