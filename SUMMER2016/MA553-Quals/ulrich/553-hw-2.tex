\begin{problem}
  Let $G$ be the group of order $2^n\cdot 3$, $n\geq 2$. Show that $G$ has
  a normal $2$-subgroup $\neq\left\{e\right\}$.
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
  Suppose that $\card G=2^n\cdot 3$. By the first Sylow theorem, $G$
  contains a $2$-Sylow subgroup, i.e., a subgroup $P$ of order
  $\card P=2^3$; this is, by Corollary 5.3, a $2$-subgroup. Now, by
  Corollary 5.8 (iii), it suffices to show that $P$ is the only $2$-Sylow
  subgroup. By The third Sylow theorem, the number of $2$-Sylow subgroups
  $n_2$ is $n_2\equiv 1\mod 2$ so either $n_2=1$ or $n_2=3$.

  Suppose that $n_2=3$. The

\begin{problem}
  Let $G$ be a group of order $p^2q$, $p$ and $q$ primes. Show that the
  Sylow $p$-Sylow subgroup or the $q$-Sylow subgroup of $G$ is normal in
  $G$.

\begin{problem}
  Let $G$ be a subgroup of order $pqr$, $p<q<r$ primes. Show that the

\begin{problem}
  Let $G$ be a group of order $n$ and let $\varphi\colon G\to S_n$ be given
  by the action of $G$ on $G$ via translation.
  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*),noitemsep]
  \item For $a\in G$ determine the number and the lengths of the disjoint
    cycles of the permutation $\varphi(a)$.
  \item Show that $\varphi(G)\nsubset A_n$ if and only if $n$ is even and
    $G$ has a cyclic $2$-Sylow subgroup.
  \item If $n=2m$, $m$ odd, show that $G$ has a subgroup of index $2$.
