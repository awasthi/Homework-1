\begin{problem}
  Let \(G\) be the group of order \(2^n\cdot 3\), \(n\geq 2\). Show that
  \(G\) has a normal \(2\)-subgroup \(\neq\left\{e\right\}\).
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
  Suppose \(\card G=2^n\cdot 3\). By Sylow's theorem, \(G\) contains a
  \(2\)-Sylow subgroup \(P\) of order \(\card P=2^n\). If \(P\) is the
  unique \(2\)-Sylow subgroup in \(G\), \(P\trileq G\). Otherwise, Sylow's
  theorem implies that \(\card({\Syl_2(G)})\) must divide \(3\) and, since
  \(3\) is prime, must in fact equal \(3\). Then, each \(Q\in\Syl_2(G)\) is
  conjugate to \(P\). \textru{Мы не знали про}po

\begin{problem}
  Let \(G\) be a group of order \(p^2q\), \(p\) and \(q\) primes. Show that

\begin{problem}
  Let \(G\) be a group of order \(n\) and let \(\varphi\colon G\to S_n\) be
  given by the action of \(G\) on \(G\) via translation.
  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*),noitemsep]
  \item For \(a\in G\) determine the number and the lengths of the disjoint
    cycles of the permutation \(\varphi(a)\).
  \item Show that \(\varphi(G)\nsubset A_n\) if and only if \(n\) is even
    and \(G\) has a cyclic \(2\)-Sylow subgroup.
  \item If \(n=2m\), \(m\) odd, show that \(G\) has a subgroup of index
    \(2\).
