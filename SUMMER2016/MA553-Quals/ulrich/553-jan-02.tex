\begin{problem}
  Let \(G\) be a group and \(H\) a subgroup of finite index. Show that
  there exists a normal subgroup \(N\) of \(G\) of finite index with
  \(N\subseteq H\).
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
  Let \(n=[G:H]\) and \(X=\left\{\,H,g_1H,\dotsc,g_{n-1}H\,\right\}\) the
  set of left-cosets of \(H\) in \(G\) with representatives
  \(g_0=e,g_1,\dotsc,g_{n-1}\). Let \(G\) act on \(X\) by left
  multiplication, i.e., \(g\mapsto g g_iH\); this is indeed an action since
  \(e(g_iH)=eg_iH=g_iH\) for all \(g_iH\in X\) and for \(k_1,k_2\in G\)
  \(k_2(k_1g_iH)=k_2k_1g_iH=(k_2k_1)g_iH\). By Cayley's theorem, this
  induces a homomorphism \(\varphi\colon G\to S_n\). Note that the action
  is not necessarily faithful. However, by the first isomorphism theorem,
  the kernel of \(\varphi\), \(N=\Ker\varphi\), is a normal subgroup of
  \(G\) with index \([G:N]\leq \card S_n=n!\) and \(N\subseteq H\) since
  \(g\in N\) if and only if \(gg_iH=g_iH\) which, in particular, implies
  that \(gH=H\). Thus, \(N\subseteq H\) and \([G:N]<\infty\).
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}
  Show that every group of order \(992\) (\(=32\cdot 31\) is solvable.
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
  Suppose \(G\) is a group with order \(\card G=992=2^5\cdot 31\). By
  Sylow's theorem, the number of \(2\)-Sylow subgroups in \(G\) is either
  \(1\) or \(3\). If the number of \(2\)-Sylow subgroups is \(1\), then
  \(P\trileq G\) and the quotient \(G/P\) has order \([G:P]=3\), hence, is
  cyclic. Moreover, since \(P\) is a \(p\)-group, it is solvable. Since
  \(P\) and \(G/P\) are solvable, \(G\) is solvable.

  Now, suppose the number of \(2\)-Sylow subgroups is \(3\). Let
  \(\Syl_2(G)=\{P,P_1,P_2\}\). Then, by Sylow's theorem, the three
  \(2\)-Sylow subgroups are conjugate, i.e., there exists \(g_1,g_2\in G\)
  such that \(P_1=g_1P{g_1}^{-1}\) and \(P_2=g_2P{g_2}^{-1}\). Thus, \(G\)
  acts on the set \(\Syl_2(P)\) by conjugation. This actions defines a (not
  necessarily injective) homomorphism \(\varphi\colon G\to S_3\). Now, we
  ask: What is the kernel of this homomorphism? By the first isomorphism
  theorem, we know that the index of the kernel in \(G\) divides the order
  of \(S_3\), i.e., \([G:{\Ker\varphi}]\mid 6\). Since \(\card G<\infty\)
  implies that the order of the kernel is one of the following values
  \[
    \card(\Ker\varphi)=2^4,2^4\cdot 3,2^5,2^5\cdot 3.
  \]
  Now, \(\card(\Ker\varphi)\neq 2^5\cdot 3\) since we know at least one
  automorphism, namely conjugation by \(g_1\), which sends
  \(P\mapsto P_1\). Thus, the order of the kernel is either \(2^4\),
  \(2^4\cdot 3\) or \(2^5\). If the \(\card(\Ker\varphi)=2^4\) or \(2^5\),
  we are done for similar reasons to the argument we gave in the previous
  paragraph, namely, that \(\Ker\varphi\trileq G\) and \(G/{\Ker\varphi}\)
  is solvable (for \(\card(\Ker\varphi)=2^4\), the quotient
  \(G/{\Ker\varphi}\) has order \(6\) so is isomorphic to one of two
  groups, \(S_3\) or \(Z_6\), both of which are solvable).

  Suppose \(\Ker\varphi\) has order \(2^4\cdot 3\). Then the number of
  \(3\)-Sylow subgroups is either \(1\), \(4\) or \(16\). If this number is
  \(1\), we are done as \(Q\in \Syl_3({\Ker\varphi})\) is a normal subgroup
  and the quotient is a \(p\)-group. Suppose the number of \(3\)-Sylow
  subgroups is \(16\). Then there are \(16\cdot 2=32\) elements of order
  \(3\) in \(\Ker\varphi\).
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}
  Let \(G\) be a group of order \(56\) with a normal \(2\)-Sylow subgroup
  \(Q\), and let \(P\) be a \(7\)-Sylow subgroup of \(G\). Show that either
  \(G\cong P\times Q\) or \(Q\cong\bbZ/(2)\times\bbZ/(2)\times\bbZ/(2)\).

  [\emph{Hint}: \(P\) acts on \(Q\setminus\{e\}\) via conjugation. Show
  that this action is either trivial or transitive.]
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
  First, note that, by the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, the order of
  \(G\) can be broken down into \(56=2^3 \cdot 7\). Suppose \(G\) has a
  normal \(2\)-Sylow subgroup \(Q\) and let \(P\in\Syl_3(G)\). Then
  \(\card(\Syl_3(G))=1,4\). If \(\card(\Syl_3(G))=1\), then \(P\) is the
  unique \(3\)-Sylow subgroup of \(G\), hence it is normal. Thus,
  \((\card P)(\card Q)=\card G\) and \(PQ=G\) since, if \(g\in Q\cap G\),
  then \(\ord g=3\), but \(2\mid \ord g\) so \(g=e\). Thus,
  \(G\cong P\times Q\).

  Now, suppose \(\card(\Syl_3(G))=4\). Then \(G\) contains \(4\)
  \(3\)-Sylow subgroups which, by Sylow's theorem, are conjugate, i.e.,
  there exists \(g_1,g_2,g_3\in G\) such that
  \(\Syl_p(G)=\left\{P,g_1P{g_1}^{-1},g_2P{g_2}^{-1},g_3P{g_3}^{-1}\right\}\). Let
  \(P\) act on \(Q\) by conjugation. Then
\end{solution}
