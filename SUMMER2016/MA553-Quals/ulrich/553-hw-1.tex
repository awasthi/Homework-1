\section{Homework}
Most of the homework is Ulrich original (or as original as elementary
exercises in abstract algebra can be). However, an excellent resource and
one that I will often quote on these solutions is \cite{hungerford}. Other
resources include \cite{dummit-foote} and (to a lesser extent)
\cite{herstein}. I may also cite Milne's \emph{Group Theory}, \emph{Field
  Theory}, and \emph{Commutative Algebra: A Primer} notes, respectively,
\cite{milneGT}, \cite{milneFT}, and (no reference for the last).

\subsection{Homework 1}
\begin{problem}
  Let $G$ be a group, $a\in G$ an element of finite order $m$, and $n$ a
  positive integer. Prove that
  \[
    |a^n|=\frac{m}{(m,n)}.
  \]
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
  Let $\ell$ denote the order of $a^n$. Then $\ell$ is the minimal power of
  $a^n$ such that ${(a^n)}^\ell=e$. Now, observe that
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:1:1}
    \begin{aligned}
      {(a^n)}^{m/(m,n)}
      &=a^{nm/(m,n)}\\
      &=a^{mn/(m,n)}\\
      &={(a^m)}^{n/(m,n)}\\
      &=e^{n/(m,n)}\\
      &=e.
    \end{aligned}
  \end{equation}
  Thus $\ell\leq m/(m,n)$.

  On the other hand, by Theorem 3.4 (iv) from \cite[Ch.\@ I \S 3.3, p.\@
  35]{hungerford} since ${(a^n)}^\ell=a^{n\ell}=e$ and the order of $a$ is
  $m$, $m\mid n\ell$ or, equivalently, $mk=n\ell$ for some
  $k\in\bbZ^+$. Now, since $(m,n)\mid m$ and $(m,n)\mid n$, we can
  represent $m$ and $n$ as the products $(m,n)m'$ and $(m,n)n'$,
  respectively. Now, note that $m'=m/(n,m)$ so we must show that
  $m'\leq\ell$. Putting all of this together, we have $mk$
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:1:2}
    mk=(m,n)m'k=(m,n)n'\ell=n\ell
  \end{equation}
  so
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:1:3}
    m'k=n'\ell.
  \end{equation}
  Thus $m'\mid n'\ell$ so either $m'\mid n'$ or $m'\mid\ell$. But since we
  factored the $(m,n)$ from $m$ and $n$, it follows that $(m',n')=1$ so
  $m'\mid \ell$. Therefore $m'\leq\ell$ and equality holds, that is,
  $\ell=m/(m,n)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}
  Let $G$ be a group, and let $a$, $b$ be elements of finite order $m$, $n$
  respectively. Show that if $ba=ab$ and
  $\langle a\rangle\cap\langle b\rangle=\{e\}$, then $|ab|=mn/(m,n)$.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
  Let $\ell$ denote the order of $ab$. If we play around with the powers of
  $ab$ we have
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:1:4}
    \begin{aligned}
      {(ab)}^{mn/(m,n)}
      &={((ab)^m)}^{n/(m,n)}\\
      &={(a^mb^m)^{n/(m,n)}}\\
      &={(b^m)^{n/(m,n)}}\\
      &=b^{mn/(m,n)}\\
      &=b^{nm/(m,n)}\\
      &={(b^n)}^{m/(m,n)}\\
      &=e^{m/(m,n)}\\
      &=e
    \end{aligned}
  \end{equation}
  so by Theorem 3.4 (iv) from \cite[Ch.\@ I \S 3.3, p.\@ 35]{hungerford},
  $\ell\mid mn/(m,n)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}
  Let $G$ be a group and $H$, $K$ normal subgroups with $H\cap
  K=\{e\}$. Show that
  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*),noitemsep]
  \item $hk=kh$ for every $h\in H$, $k\in K$.
  \item $HK$ is a subgroup of $G$ with $HK\simeq H\times K$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}
  Show that $A_4$ has no subgroup of order $6$ (although $6\mid 12=|A_4|$).
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
\end{proof}
