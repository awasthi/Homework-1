\subsection{Homework}
Most of the homework is Ulrich original (or as original as elementary
exercises in abstract algebra can be). However, an excellent resource and
one that I will often quote on these solutions is \cite{hungerford}. Other
resources include \cite{dummit-foote} and (to a lesser extent)
\cite{herstein}. I may also cite Milne's \emph{Group Theory}, \emph{Field
  Theory}, and \emph{Commutative Algebra: A Primer} notes, respectively,
\cite{milneGT}, \cite{milneFT}, and (no reference for the last). Unless
otherwise stated, whenever we quote a result, e.g., Theorem 1.1, it is
understood to come from Hungerford's \emph{Algebra}.

\subsubsection{Homework 1}
\setcounter{exercise}{0}
\begin{problem}
  Let $G$ be a group, $a\in G$ an element of finite order $m$, and $n$ a
  positive integer. Prove that
  \[
    |a^n|=\frac{m}{(m,n)}.
  \]
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
  Let $\ell$ denote the order of $a^n$. Then $\ell$ is the minimal power of
  $a^n$ such that ${(a^n)}^\ell=e$. Now, observe that
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:1:1}
    \begin{aligned}
      {(a^n)}^{m/(m,n)}
      &=a^{nm/(m,n)}\\
      &=a^{mn/(m,n)}\\
      &={(a^m)}^{n/(m,n)}\\
      &=e^{n/(m,n)}\\
      &=e.
    \end{aligned}
  \end{equation}
  Thus $\ell\leq m/(m,n)$.

  On the other hand, by Theorem 3.4 (iv) from \cite[Ch.\@ I \S 3.3, p.\@
  35]{hungerford} since ${(a^n)}^\ell=a^{n\ell}=e$ and the order of $a$ is
  $m$, $m\mid n\ell$ or, equivalently, $mk=n\ell$ for some
  $k\in\bbZ^+$. Now, since $(m,n)\mid m$ and $(m,n)\mid n$, we can
  represent $m$ and $n$ as the products $(m,n)m'$ and $(m,n)n'$,
  respectively. Now, note that $m'=m/(n,m)$ so we must show that
  $m'\leq\ell$. Putting all of this together, we have $mk$
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:1:2}
    mk=(m,n)m'k=(m,n)n'\ell=n\ell
  \end{equation}
  so
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:1:3}
    m'k=n'\ell.
  \end{equation}
  Thus $m'\mid n'\ell$ so either $m'\mid n'$ or $m'\mid\ell$. But since we
  factored the $(m,n)$ from $m$ and $n$, it follows that $(m',n')=1$ so
  $m'\mid \ell$. Therefore $m'\leq\ell$ and equality holds, that is,
  $\ell=m/(m,n)$.
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}
  Let $G$ be a group, and let $a$, $b$ be elements of finite order $m$, $n$
  respectively. Show that if $ba=ab$ and
  $\langle a\rangle\cap\langle b\rangle=\{e\}$, then $|ab|=mn/(m,n)$.
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
  Let $\ell$ denote the order of $ab$. Now, playing around with powers of
  $ab$, we have
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:1:4}
    \begin{aligned}
      (ab)^{n}
      &=a^nb^n\\
      &=a^n\\
      &\neq e
    \end{aligned}
  \end{equation}
  since the order of $a$ is $m$ and $n<m$. Thus, by Problem 1,
  $|a^n|=m/(m,n)$ so $|ab|=mn/(m,n)$.
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}
  Let $G$ be a group and $H$, $K$ normal subgroups with $H\cap
  K=\{e\}$. Show that
  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*),noitemsep]
  \item $hk=kh$ for every $h\in H$, $k\in K$.
  \item $HK$ is a subgroup of $G$ with $HK\simeq H\times K$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
  (a) Suppose that $H$ and $K$ are normal in $G$. Then, for every $g\in G$,
  $gh=hg$ and $gk=kg$ for any $h\in H$, $k\in K$. In particular, since
  $H\subset G$, $h\in G$ so $hk=kh$.
  \\\\
  (b) Consider the subset $HK$ of $G$ consisting of all products $hk$ where
  $h\in H$, $k\in K$. First, we show that $HK$ is closed under
  multiplication: Pick $h_1k_1,h_2k_2\in HK$ then
  $h_1k_1h_2k_2=h_1(k_1k_2)h_2=h_1h_2(k_1k_2)$ is in $HK$ since $h_1h_2\in
  H$, $k_1k_2\in K$. Moreover, since $e\in H$ and $e\in K$, $ee=e\in
  HK$. Lastly, given $hk\in HK$,
  $hkh^{-1}k^{-1}=(hkh^{-1})k^{-1}=kk^{-1}=e$ so $HK$ is closed under
  taking inverses. Thus, $HK$ is a subgroup of $G$.

  To see that $HK\simeq H\times K$, consider the map
  $\varphi\colon HK\to (HK/K)\times(HK/H)$ given by
  $\varphi(hk)\coloneq(\pi_K(h),\pi_H(k))$ where $\pi_H\colon HK\to HK/H$
  and $\pi_K\colon HK\to HK/K$ are quotient maps. By the first (or second)
  isomorphism theorem, $H\simeq HK/H$ and $K\simeq HK/H$ so $HK\simeq
  H\times K$.
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}
  Show that $A_4$ has no subgroup of order $6$ (although $6\mid 12=|A_4|$).
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
  Suppose that $6$ has a subgroup of order $6$ say $H$. Then, by Cauchy's
  theorem, $H$ contains an element $h$ of order $2$, $3$ or $6$. If the
  order of $h$ is $6$, $H$ must be cyclic and hence normal in $A_4$. But
  $A_4$ is simple. If $h$ has order $2$, then the subgroup generated by $h$
  is normal in $G$ which, as we previously mentioned, is
  impossible. Lastly, if $h$ has order $3$ then $h$ must be a product of
  disjoint $3$ cycles.
\end{solution}
