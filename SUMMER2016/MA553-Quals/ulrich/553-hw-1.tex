This is material from the course MA 533 as it was taught in the spring of
2016.

\section{Homework}
Most of the homework is Ulrich original (or as original as elementary
exercises in abstract algebra can be). However, an excellent resource and
one that I will often quote on these solutions is \cite{hungerford}. Other
resources include \cite{dummit-foote} and (to a lesser extent)
\cite{herstein}. I may also cite Milne's \emph{Group Theory}, \emph{Field
  Theory}, and \emph{Commutative Algebra: A Primer} notes, respectively,
\cite{milneGT}, \cite{milneFT}, and (no reference for the last).

\subsection{Homework 1}
\begin{problem}
  Let $G$ be a group, $a\in G$ an element of finite order $m$, and $n$ a
  positive integer. Prove that
  \[
    |a^n|=\frac{m}{\gcd(m,n)}.
  \]
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
  Without loss of generality, we may assume $n<m$; otherwise, by the
  fundamental theorem of arithmetic, there exist $q$ and $r$ with $r<m$
  such that $n=qm+r$ so $a^n=a^{qm+r}=a^{qm}a^r=a^r$.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}
  Let $G$ be a group, and let $a$, $b$ be elements of finite order $m$, $n$
  respectively. Show that if $ba=ab$ and
  $\langle a\rangle\cap\langle b\rangle=\{e\}$, then $|ab|=\lcm(m,n)$.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}
  Let $G$ be a group and $H$, $K$ normal subgroups with $H\cap
  K=\{e\}$. Show that
  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*),noitemsep]
  \item $hk=kh$ for every $h\in H$, $k\in K$.
  \item $HK$ is a subgroup of $G$ with $HK\simeq H\times K$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}
  Show that $A_4$ has no subgroup of order $6$ (although $6\mid 12=|A_4|$).
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
\end{proof}
