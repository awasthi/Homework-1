\thispagestyle{empty}

These notes roughly correspond to the three sections (by the same name) on
groups, rings and fields from Dummit and Foote's \emph{Abstract Algebra}
\cite{dummit-foote:abstract-algebra}. I also make nominal use of Herstein's
\emph{Topics in Abstract Algebra} \cite{herstein:topics-in-algebra}

\section{Group Theory}
