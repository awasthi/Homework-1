\begin{problem}[Wheeden \& Zygmund Ch.\@ 4, Ex.\@ 4]
  Let $f$ be defined and measurable in $\bbR^n$. If $T$ is a nonsingular
  linear transformation of $\bbR^n$, show that $f(T\bfx)$ is
  measurable. [If $E_1=\left\{\,\bfx: f(\bfx)>a\,\right\}$ and
  $E_2=\left\{\,\bfx:f(T\bfx)>a\,\right\}$, show $E_2=T^{-1}E_1$.]

\begin{problem}[Wheeden \& Zygmund Ch.\@ 4, Ex.\@ 7]
  Let $f$ be usc and less that $\infty$ on a compact set $E$. Show that $f$
  is bounded above on $E$. Show also that $f$ assumes its maximum on $E$,
  i.e., that there exists $\bfx_0\in E$ such that $f(\bfx_0)\geq f(\bfx)$
  for all $\bfx\in E$.

  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*),noitemsep]
  \item Let $f$ and $g$ be two functions which are usc at $\bfx_0$. Show
    that $f+g$ is usc at $\bfx_0$. Is $f-g$ usc at $\bfx_0$? When is $fg$
    usc at $\bfx_0$?
  \item If $\left\{f_k\right\}$ is a sequence of functions are usc at
    $\bfx_0$, show that $\inf f_k(\bfx)$ is usc at $\bfx_0$.
  \item If $\left\{f_k\right\}$ is a sequence of functions which are usc at
    $\bfx_0$ and which converge uniformly near $\bfx_0$, show that
    $\lim f_k$ is usc at $\bfx_0$.
