\chapter{MA 544 Spring 2016}
\thispagestyle{empty}
This is material from the course MA 544 as it was taught in the spring of
2016.
\bigskip
\section{Homework}
These exercises were assigned from Wheeden and Zygmund's \emph{Measure and
  Integral}. Therefore, most of the theorems I reference will be from
\cite{wheeden-zygmund}. Other resources include \cite{folland} and
\cite{royden}. For more elementary results, I cite \cite{rudin-1}.

Here are some notational conventions we will use in our solutions (we state
them here, because they differ from the notation used by Wheeden and
Zygmund):

\bigskip

\begin{tabular}{c|l}
$\bbR$&the real line\\
$\bbC$&the complex plane\\
$\bbQ$&the rational numbers\\
$\bbN$&the natural numbers $1,2,\dotsc$\\
$A\smallsetminus B$&the set difference of $A$ and $B$\\
$m(E)$&the Lebesgue measure of a set $E$\\
$m^*(E)$&the outer measure of a set $E$\\
$m_*(E)$&the inner measure of a set $E$\\
$\|\cdot\|$&the standard Euclidean norm on $\bbR^n$ (or a Banach)\\
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Homework 1}
\begin{problem}[Wheeden \& Zygmund Ch.\@ 2, Ex.\@ 1]
Let $f(x)=x\sin(1/x)$ for $0<x\leq 1$ and $f(0)=0$. Show that $f$ is
bounded and continuous on $[0,1]$, but that $V[f;0,1]=+\infty$.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
Set $f\coloneqq x\sin(1/x)$. We will show that $f$ is bounded an continuous
on $[0,1]$, but that, nevertheless, it $f$ is not of bounded variation on
$[0,1]$. Suppose $\bfphi$

  % It is clear that the function $f(x)=x\sin(1/x)$ is
%   \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounded_function}{\emph{bounded}} on
%   $[0,1]$ since $|{\sin(1/x)}|\leq 1$ and $|x|\leq 1$ on $[0,1]$, that is,
%   $|x\sin(1/x)|\leq 1$. Moreover, by properties of
%   \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function#Weierstrass_definition_.28epsilon.E2.80.93delta.29_of_continuous_functions}{\emph{continuous
%       functions}} on $\bbR$, it is easy to see that $f$ is continuous on
%   $(0,1)$ (this comes as a simple application of \cite[Ch.\@ 4, p.\@
%   87]{rudin-1}). What is not obvious is continuity at $0$. To show that $f$
%   is continuous at $0$, by Theorem 4.6 from \cite[Ch.\@ 4, p.\@
%   86]{rudin-1}, it suffices to show that $\lim_{x\to 0}f(x)=0$. Consider
%   the sequence $\{1/k\}$. This sequence converges to $0$. Moreover, given
%   $\varepsilon>0$, by the Archimedean principle, for sufficiently large
%   $K$, the inequality $1/K<\varepsilon$ holds so for every $k\geq K$ we
%   have
% \begin{equation}
% \label{eq:1:1}
% |{(1/k)\sin(k)-0}|\leq
% |1/k|<\varepsilon.
% \end{equation}
% Thus, $\lim_{k\to\infty}f(1/k)=0$. Thus, $f$ is continuous on all of
% $[0,1]$.

% Nevertheless, $f$ is not of
% \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounded_variation}{\emph{bounded
%     variation}} on $[0,1]$. By Corollary 2.10 from \cite[Ch.\@ 2, p.\@
% 23]{wheeden-zygmund}, the
% \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_variation}{\emph{total
%     variation}} $V$ of $f$ on $[0,1]$ is given by
% \begin{equation}
% \label{eq:1:2}
% \begin{aligned}
% V&=\int_0^1|f'|\diff x\\
% &=\int_0^1|{\sin(1/x)-(1/x)\cos(1/x)}|\diff x\\
% &=\int_1^\infty\frac{1}{u^2}|{\sin u-u\cos u}|\diff x\\
% &\geq\int_M^\infty \frac{1}{2u}\diff u\\
% &=\infty,
% \end{aligned}
% \end{equation}
% where, for sufficiently large $M$, for $u\geq M$ we have $|{\sin u- u\cos
%   u}|>u/2$. Thus, $f$ is not b.v.\@ on $[0,1]$.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}[Wheeden \& Zygmund Ch.\@ 2, Ex.\@ 2]
Prove theorem (2.1).
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
Recall the statement of theorem (2.1):
\begin{quote}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item If $f$ is of bounded variation on $[a,b]$, then $f$ is bounded on
  $[a,b]$.
\item Let $f$ and $g$ be of bounded variation on $[a,b]$. Then $cf$ (for
  any real constant $c$), $f+g$, and $fg$ are of bounded variation on
  $[a,b]$. Moreover, $f/g$ is of bounded variation on $[a,b]$ if there
  exists an $\varepsilon>0$ such that $|g(x)|\geq\varepsilon$ for
  $x\in[a,b]$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{quote}
\noindent
(a)
\\\\
(b)
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}[Wheeden \& Zygmund Ch.\@ 2, Ex.\@ 3]
If $[a',b']$ is a subinterval of $[a,b]$ show that $P[a',b']\leq P[a,b]$
and $N[a',b']\leq N[a,b]$.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
\end{proof}
\begin{problem}[Wheeden \& Zygmund Ch.\@ 2, Ex.\@ 11]
Show that $\int_a^bf\diff\varphi$ exists if and only if given $\varepsilon>0$
there exists $\delta>0$ such that
$\left|R_\Gamma-R_{\Gamma'}\right|<\varepsilon$ if
$|\Gamma|,|\Gamma'|<\delta$.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}[Wheeden \& Zygmund Ch.\@ 2, Ex.\@ 13]
Prove theorem (2.16).
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
Recall the statement of Theorem 2.16:
\begin{quote}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
\item If $\int_a^b f\diff\varphi$ exists, then so do $\int_a^bcf\diff\varphi$ and
  $\int_a^b f\diff(c\varphi)$ for any constant $c$, and
\[
\int_a^bcf\diff\varphi=\int_a^bf\diff(c\varphi)=c\int_a^bf\diff\varphi.
\]
\item If $\int_a^b f_1\diff\varphi$ and $\int_a^bf_2\diff\varphi$ both exist, so
  does $\int_a^b\left(f_1+f_2\right)\diff\varphi$, and
\[
\int_a^b\left(f_1+f_2\right)\diff\varphi=\int_a^bf_1\diff\varphi+\int_a^bf_2\diff\varphi.
\]
\item If $\int_a^bf\diff\varphi_1$ and $\int_a^bf\diff\varphi_2$ both exist, so
  does $\int_a^bf\diff\left(\varphi_1+\varphi_2\right)$, and
\[
\int_a^bf\diff\left(\varphi_1+\varphi_2\right)=\int_a^bf\diff\varphi_1+\int_a^bf\diff\varphi_2.
\]
\end{enumerate}
\end{quote}
\end{proof}
