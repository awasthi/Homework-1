\section{Homework}
These exercises were assigned from Wheeden and Zygmund's \emph{Measure and
  Integral}, therefore, most of the theorems I reference will be from
\cite{wheeden-zygmund}. Other resources include \cite{folland} and
\cite{royden}. For more elementary results, I cite \cite{rudin-1}.

\subsection{Homework 1}
\begin{problem}[Wheeden \& Zygmund Ch.\@ 2, Ex.\@ 1]
Let $f(x)=x\sin(1/x)$ for $0<x\leq 1$ and $f(0)=0$. Show that $f$ is
bounded and continuous on $[0,1]$, but that $V[f;0,1]=+\infty$.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
 Set $f\coloneqq x\sin (1/x)$. We will show that $f$ is bounded and
 \gls{cont} on $[0,1]$ but that, nevertheless, $f$ is not of \gls{bv} on
 $[0,1]$.

 To see that $f$ is bounded, we note that both $x$ and $\sin(1/x)$ are
 bounded by $1$ on $[0,1]$. Thus, the absolute value of the product product
 $|{x\sin(1/x)}|$ is bounded by $1$ so $f$ is bounded on $[0,1]$.

 To see that $f$ is continuous, we use note that, since $\sin(1/x)$ and $x$
 are continuous on $(0,1]$, by properties of continuous functions (you may
 refer to \cite[Ch.\@ 4, p.\@ 87]{rudin-1}), $f$ is continuous on $(0,1]$.
 What is not obvious is continuity at $0$. To show that $f$ is continuous
 at $0$, by Theorem 4.6 from \cite[Ch.\@ 4, p.\@ 86]{rudin-1}, it suffices
 to show that $\lim_{x\to 0}f(x)=0$. Consider the sequence $\{a_n\}$ where
 $a_n\coloneqq 1/n$. The sequence $a_n\to 0$ as $n\to\infty$. Now, given
 $\varepsilon>0$, by the \gls{ArchProp}, for sufficiently  large
 $N\in\bbZ^+$, $1/N<\varepsilon$ holds so for every $n\geq N$. Thus, we have
 \begin{equation}
   \label{eq:1:1}
   |{(1/k)\sin(k)-0}|\leq
   |1/k|<\varepsilon.
 \end{equation}
 Thus, $\lim_{k\to\infty}f(1/k)=0$. Thus, $f$ is continuous on all of
 $[0,1]$.

 Nevertheless, $f$ is not b.v.\@ on $[0,1]$. To see this, note that since
 $f$ is differentiable on $[0,1]$, by Corollary 2.10 from \cite[Ch.\@ 2,
 p.\@ 23]{wheeden-zygmund}, we have
 \begin{equation}
   \label{eq:1:2}
   \begin{aligned}
     V&=\int_0^1|f'|\diff x\\
     &=\int_0^1|{\sin(1/x)-(1/x)\cos(1/x)}|\diff x\\
     &=\int_1^\infty\frac{1}{u^2}|{\sin u-u\cos u}|\diff x\\
     &\geq\int_M^\infty \frac{1}{2u}\diff u\\
     &=\infty,
   \end{aligned}
 \end{equation}
 where, for sufficiently large $M\in\bbZ^+$, for $u\geq M$, we have
 $|{\sin u- u\cos u}|>u/2$. Thus, $f$ is not b.v.\@ on $[0,1]$.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}[Wheeden \& Zygmund Ch.\@ 2, Ex.\@ 2]
Prove theorem (2.1).
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
  Recall the statement of theorem (2.1):
  \begin{quote}
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*),noitemsep]
    \item If $f$ is of bounded variation on $[a,b]$, then $f$ is bounded on
      $[a,b]$.
    \item Let $f$ and $g$ be of bounded variation on $[a,b]$. Then $cf$
      (for any real constant $c$), $f+g$, and $fg$ are of bounded variation
      on $[a,b]$. Moreover, $f/g$ is of bounded variation on $[a,b]$ if
      there exists an $\varepsilon>0$ such that $|g(x)|\geq\varepsilon$ for
      $x\in[a,b]$.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{quote}
  \noindent%
  (a) We shall proceed by contradiction. Suppose $f$ is of \gls{bv}\@ on
  $[a,b]$ with total variation $V$, but that $f$ is not \gls{bdd} on
  $[a,b]$. Then, for every $M\in\bbR^+$, there exist $x\in[a,b]$ such that
  $|f(x)|>M$. Hence, there exist $x^*\in[a,b]$ such that
  $|f(x^*)|>V+|f(a)|$ so, by the reverse triangle inequality, we have
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:1:3}
    \begin{aligned}
      |f(a)-f(x^*)|+|f(x^*)-f(b)| &\geq
      |(V-|f(a)|)-|f(a)||+|V+(|f(a)|-|f(b)|)|\\
      &=V+|V+(|f(a)|-|f(b)|)|\\
      &>V.
    \end{aligned}
  \end{equation}
  Since $\Gamma^*\coloneqq\{a,x^*,b\}$ is a partition of $[a,b]$ and $f$ is
  b.v.\@ on $[a,b]$, we must have $S_{\Gamma^*}\leq V$. This is a
  contradiction. Thus, it must be the case that $f$ is bounded on
  $[a,b]$. %
  \\\\
  (b) Suppose $f$ and $g$ are b.v.\@ on $[a,b]$ with variation $V_f$ and
  $V_g$, respectively.

  Let $c$ be a real number. Given a partition $\Gamma=\{x_0,\dotsc,x_n\}$
  of $[a,b]$, we have
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:eq:1:4}
    \begin{aligned}
      S_\Gamma&=\sum_{i=0}^n|cf(x_i)-cf(x_{i-1})|\\
      &=\sum_{i=0}^n|c||f(x_i)-f(x_{i-1})|\\
      &=|c|\underbrace{\left(\sum_{i=0}^n|f(x_i)-f(x_{i-1})|\right)}_{S_{\Gamma,f}}.
    \end{aligned}
  \end{equation}
  But since $f$ is b.v.\@ on $[a,b]$, $S_{\Gamma,f}\leq V_F$ so
  $S_\Gamma\leq cV_f$. Since $\Gamma$ was chosen arbitrarily, it follows
  that $cf$ is b.v.\@ on $[a,b]$.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}[Wheeden \& Zygmund Ch.\@ 2, Ex.\@ 3]
If $[a',b']$ is a subinterval of $[a,b]$ show that $P[a',b']\leq P[a,b]$
and $N[a',b']\leq N[a,b]$.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
\end{proof}
\begin{problem}[Wheeden \& Zygmund Ch.\@ 2, Ex.\@ 11]
Show that $\int_a^bf\diff\varphi$ exists if and only if given $\varepsilon>0$
there exists $\delta>0$ such that
$\left|R_\Gamma-R_{\Gamma'}\right|<\varepsilon$ if
$|\Gamma|,|\Gamma'|<\delta$.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}[Wheeden \& Zygmund Ch.\@ 2, Ex.\@ 13]
Prove theorem (2.16).
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
Recall the statement of Theorem 2.16:
\begin{quote}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*),noitemsep]
\item If $\int_a^b f\diff\varphi$ exists, then so do $\int_a^bcf\diff\varphi$ and
  $\int_a^b f\diff(c\varphi)$ for any constant $c$, and
\[
\int_a^bcf\diff\varphi=\int_a^bf\diff(c\varphi)=c\int_a^bf\diff\varphi.
\]
\item If $\int_a^b f_1\diff\varphi$ and $\int_a^bf_2\diff\varphi$ both exist, so
  does $\int_a^b\left(f_1+f_2\right)\diff\varphi$, and
\[
\int_a^b\left(f_1+f_2\right)\diff\varphi=\int_a^bf_1\diff\varphi+\int_a^bf_2\diff\varphi.
\]
\item If $\int_a^bf\diff\varphi_1$ and $\int_a^bf\diff\varphi_2$ both exist, so
  does $\int_a^bf\diff\left(\varphi_1+\varphi_2\right)$, and
\[
\int_a^bf\diff\left(\varphi_1+\varphi_2\right)=\int_a^bf\diff\varphi_1+\int_a^bf\diff\varphi_2.
\]
\end{enumerate}
\end{quote}
\end{proof}
