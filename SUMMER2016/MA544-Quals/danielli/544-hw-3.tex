\begin{problem}[Wheeden \& Zygmund Ch.\@ 3, Ex.\@ 5]
Construct a subset of $[0,1]$ in the same manner as the Cantor set, except
that at the $k$th stage each interval removed has length $\delta 3^{-k}$,
$0<\delta<1$. Show that the resulting set is perfect, has measure
$1-\delta$, and contains no interval.

\begin{problem}[Wheeden \& Zygmund Ch.\@ 3, Ex.\@ 9]
  If ${\{E_k\}}_{k=1}^\infty$ is a sequence of sets with
  $\sum|{E_k}|_e<+\infty$, show that $\limsup E_k$ (and also
  $\liminf E_k$) has measure zero.
