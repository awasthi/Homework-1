I lost this exam. These are the questions I could recall explicitly. For
the first problem, we were asked to show that the Dichlet function
\(\indicate_\bbQ(x)\) is not Riemann integrable and prove something about
\(\bbQ\). For the second question, we were asked to show that the measure
of countable union of disjoint measurable sets \(\{E_n:n\in\bbN\}\), is
equal to the sum of their individual measures (or something to that
effect).

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*),noitemsep]
\item Show that if \(B_r=\left\{\,x\in\bbR^n:|x|<r\,\right\}\), then there
  exists a constant \(C\) such that \(|B_r|=Cr^n\).
  \\\\
  (\emph{Hint}: Think of \(B_r\) as \(\left\{\,rx:x\in B_1\,\right\}\).)
\item Let \(E\subseteq\bbR^n\) be a measurable set and let
  \(\varphi_E\colon\bbR^n\to\bbR\) be defined
  \(\varphi_E(x)=\bigl|E\cap B_{|x|}\bigr|\). Use part (i) to prove that
  \(\varphi_E\) is continuous.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{problem}
  Assume that \(f\colon[a,b]\to\bbR\) is of bounded variation on
  \([a,b]\). Prove that \(f\) is measurable.
