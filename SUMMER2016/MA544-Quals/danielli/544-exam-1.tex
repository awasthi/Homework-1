\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*),noitemsep]
\item Show that if $B_r\coloneq\left\{\,\bfx\in\bbR^n:|\bfx|<r\,\right\}$,
  then there exists a constant $C$ such that $|B_r|=Cr^n$.
\\\\
(\emph{Hint}: Think of $B_r$ as $\left\{\,r\bfx:\bfx\in B_1\,\right\}$.)
\item Let $E\subset\bbR^n$ be a measurable set and let
  $\varphi_E\colon\bbR^n\to\bbR$ be defined
  $\varphi_E(\bfx)\coloneq\left|E\cap B_{|\bfx|}\right|$. Use part (i) to prove
    that $\varphi_E$ is continuous.
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
(i) To prove this result, we use the map constructed in Problem 1 of the
review sheet for Exam 1, the map $T\colon\bbR\times\bbR^n\to\bbR^n$. Set
$T_r\colon\bbR^n\to\bbR^n$ to be $T_r\coloneq T(r)$. Then, we claim
$B_r=T_r(B_1)$ and $|B_r|=|T_r(B_1)|$, which, as we saw in Problem 1 of the
review sheet, has measure $|B_1||r|^n$. Setting $C\coloneq |B_1|$, we have
$|B_r|=C|r|^n$ as desired.
\\\\
(ii) To prove that $\varphi_E$ is continuous, we provide an
$(\varepsilon,\delta)$-argument. Let $\varepsilon>0$ be given. We must show
that there exists $\delta>0$ such that $\bfy\in B(\bfx,\delta)$ implies
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ex:1:1}
\left|\varphi_E(\bfx)-\varphi_E(\bfy)\right|<\varepsilon.
\end{equation}

First, note that since $\bfx\mapsto |\bfx|$ is continuous and polynomials
$p\colon\bbR^n\to\bbR^n$ are continuous, then the composition
$\bfx\mapsto|\bfx|^n$ is continuous. Therefore, there exists $\delta>0$
such that $\bfy\in B(\bfx,\delta)$ implies
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ex:1:2}
\left||\bfx|^n-|\bfy|^n\right|<\frac{\varepsilon}{C},
\end{equation}
where $C\coloneq |B_1|$.

Now, let $x\in\bbR^n$ and $\bfy\in B(\bfx,\delta)$ as above. Then, by
\eqref{eq:ex:1:2} we have
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ex:1:3}
\begin{aligned}
\left|\varphi_E(\bfx)-\varphi_E(\bfy)\right|
&=\left|
\left|E\cap B_{|\bfx|}\right|
-
\left|E\cap B_{|\bfy|}\right|
\right|\\
&\leq\left| |B_{|\bfx|}|-|B_{|\bfy|}|\right|\\
&=C|\left|\bfx|^n-|\bfy|^n\right|\\
&\leq C\left[\frac{\varepsilon}{C}\right]\\
&=\varepsilon.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
It follows that $\varphi_E$ is continuous.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}
Assume that $f\colon[a,b]\to\bbR$ is of bounded variation on $[a,b]$. Prove
that $f$ is measurable.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
By Jordan's theorem (Corollary 2.7 from \cite[Ch.\@ 2, p.\@
21]{wheeden-zygmund}), the function $f$ is of bounded variation on $[a,b]$
if and only if it can be written as the difference $f_1-f_2$ of two bounded
functions $f_1$ and $f_2$ that are monotone increasing on $[a,b]$. Then,
$f_1$ and $f_2$ are continuous a.e.\@ on $[a,b]$ and hence, are
measurable.
