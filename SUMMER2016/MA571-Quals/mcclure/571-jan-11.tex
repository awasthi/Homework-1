  $A$. Prove that $\bar A\setminus\bar B\subset\overline{A\setminus B}$.

\begin{problem}
  Let $G$ be a topological group (thas is, a group with a topology for
  which the group operations are continuous) and let $H$ be a subgroup of
  $G$. Suppose that $G$ is connected, that $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$,
  and that the subspace topology on $H$ is discrete. Prove that
  $g h=hg$ for every $g\in G$, $h\in G$.

\begin{problem}
  Let $X$ be the space with two points and the discrete topology. Let
  $Y=\prod_{n=1}^\infty X$, with the product topology. What are the
  connected components of $Y$? Prove that your answer is correct.

\begin{problem}
  Let $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces. Let $x_0\in X$ and let $C$ be a
  compact subset of $Y$. Let $N$ be an open set in $X\times Y$ containing
  $\left\{x_0\right\}\times C$. Prove that there is an open set $U$
  containing $x_0$ and an open set $V$ containing $C$ such that
  $U\times V\subset N$.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
  Let $X$ and $Y$ be homotopy-equivalent topological spaces. Suppose that
  $X$ is connected. Prove that $Y$ is connected.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
  Let $p\colon E\to B$ be a covering map. Let $e_0\in E$ and $b_0\in B$
  with $p(e_0)=b_0$. Let $Y$ be simply connected (in particular, $Y$ is
  path-connected). Let $y_0\in Y$. Let $f\colon Y\to B$ be continuous, with
  $f(y_0)=b_0$.

  Prove that the following function $g\colon Y\to E$ is well-defined: Given
  $y\in Y$, choose a path $\gamma$ from $y_0$ to $y$; let $\beta$ be the
  lift of $f\circ\gamma$ to $E$ starting at $e_0$; now define
  $g(y)=\beta(1)$.

  You may use the fact (without proving it) that the lift of a path
  homotopy is again a path homotopy.

\begin{problem}
  Let $S^2$ be the $2$-sphere, that is, the following subspace of $\bbR^3$:
  \[
    \left\{\,(x,y,z)\in\bbR^3:x^2+y^2+z^2=1\,\right\}.
  \]
  Let $x_0$ be the point $(0,0,1)\in S^2$.

  Use the Seifert--van Kampen theorem to prove that $\pi_1(S^2,x_0)$ is the
  trivial group. You may use either of the two versions of the Seifert--van
  Kampen theorem given in Munkres's book. You will not get credit for any
  other method.
