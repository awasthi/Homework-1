\begin{problem}
  Let \(X\) be a topological space with a countable basis. Prove that every
  open cover of \(X\) has a countable subcover.
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
  Suppose \(\calB\) is a countable basis for \(X\). Let
  \(\{B_n:n\in\bbN\}\) be an enumeration of \(\calB\) and let
  \(\calU=\{U_\alpha:\alpha\in A\}\) an open cover of \(X\). To every
  \(B_n\) in \(\calB\) associate an element \(U_n\) such that
  \(B_n\subseteq U_n\) if such an \(n\) exists; otherwise, associate to
  \(B_n\) the empty set \(\emptyset\). We claim that the subcollection
  \(\calU'=\{U_n:n\in\bbN\}\) is a countable subcover of \(\calU\).

  The countability of \(\calU'\) follows from the countability of
  \(\calB\). Let \(f\colon\calB\to\calU\) be the function which assigns
  \(B_n\) to \(U_n\). Then, by definition, \(\calU'=f(\calB)\) and,
  restricting the codomain of \(f\) to \(\calU'\), we have
  \(f'\colon\calB\to\calU'\) is surjective. Since \(\calB\) is countable,
  there exists a surjection \(g\colon\bbN\to\calB\). Then, the map
  \(f'\circ g\colon\bbN\to\calU'\) is surjective. It follows that
  \(\calU'\) is at most countable.

  It remains to show that \(\calU'\) covers \(X\). Suppose \(x\notin U_n\)
  for any \(n\in\bbN\). Then, since \(\calU\) is a cover of \(X\), there
  exists an open set \(U_\alpha\in\calU\) such that \(x\in
  U_\alpha\). Moreover, since \(\calB\) is a basis for \(X\), and
  \(U_\alpha\) is open, there exists a basis element \(B_m\in\calB\)
  containing \(x\) contained in \(U_\alpha\). It follows that there is some
  nonempty open set \(U_m\) in the cover \(\calU\) containing \(B_m\) which
  implies that \(f(B_m)\neq\emptyset\). This contradicts the assumption
  that no \(x\notin U_n\) for any \(n\in\bbN\). Thus, \(\calU'\) covers
  \(X\).

  It follows that every cover \(\calU\) of \(X\) admits a finite subcover
  \(\calU'\) of \(\calU\).
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}
  Let \(X\) be a compact space and suppose there is a finite family of
  continuous functions \(f_i\colon X\to\bbR\), \(i=1,\dotsc,n\), with the
  following property: given \(x\neq y\) in \(X\) there is an \(i\) such
  that \(f_i(x)\neq f_i(y)\). Prove that \(X\) is homeomorphic to a
  subspace of \(\bbR^n\).
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
  Consider the map \(f\colon X\to\bbR^n\) given by
  \[
    f(x)=\bigl(f_1(x),\dotsc,f_n(x)\bigr).
  \]
  By a theorem from Munkres regarding continuous bijective maps between
  compact and Hausdorff spaces, it suffices to show that the restriction
  \(f'\colon X\to f(X)\) of the codomain of \(f\) to its image \(f(X)\) is
  a bijection.

  First, from Munkres, we know that the restriction of the codomain of a
  continuous function to a subspace is again continuous. Therefore,
  \(f'\colon X\to f(X)\) is continuous.

  Moreover, since \(\bbR^n\) is Hausdorff and \(f(X)\subseteq\bbR^n\) is a
  subspace, \(f(X)\) is Hausdorff.

  Lastly, we show that \(f'\colon X\to f(X)\) is bijective. It is clear
  that \(f'\) is surjective since we have restricted the codomain of \(f\)
  to its image. To see that \(f'\) is injective let \(x,y\in X\) and
  suppose that \(f'(x)=f'(y)\). Then
  \[
    \bigl(f_1(x),\dotsc,f(x)\bigr)= \bigl(f_1(y),\dotsc,f(y)\bigr).
  \]
  This implies that \(x=y\) for otherwise, there is a \(x\neq y\) in \(X\)
  such that \(f_i(x)=f_i(y)\) for all \(1\leq i\leq n\); which contradicts
  our assumption.

  It follows that \(f'\colon X\to f(X)\) is a continuous bijection from a
  compact to a Hausdorff space and thus, is a homeomorphism.
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}
  Let \(X\) be any topological space and let \(Y\) be a Hausdorff
  space. Let \(f,g\colon X\to Y\) be continuous functions. Prove that the
  set \(\left\{\,x\in X:f(x)=g(x)\,\right\}\) is closed.
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
  Recall that a topological space $Y$ is Hausdorff if and only if the
  diagonal $\Delta=\left\{\,(y,y):y\in Y\,\right\}$ is closed in
  $Y\times Y$ with the product topology. Define a map \(F\colon X\to
  Y\times Y\) by
  \[
    F(x)=\bigl(f(x),g(x)\bigr).
  \]
  Then, by the u.m.p\@ of the product topology, \(F\) is continuous because
  \[
    (\pi_1\circ F)(x)=f(x),\quad(\pi_2\circ F)(x)=g(x)
  \]
  are continuous; where \(\pi_1,\pi_2\colon Y\times Y\to Y\) are the
  standard projections \((y_1,y_2)\mapsto y_1\) and \((y_1,y_2)\mapsto
  y_2\), respectively.
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}
  Let \(X\) be the two-point set \(\{0,1\}\) with the discrete
  topology. Let \(Y\) be a countable product of copies of \(X\); thus an
  element of \(Y\) is a sequence of \(0\)s and \(1\)s.

  For each \(n\geq 1\), let \(y_n\in Y\) be the element
  \((1,\dotsc,1,0,\dotsc)\), with \(n\) \(1\)s at the beginning and all
  other entries \(0\). Let \(y\in Y\) be the element with all \(1\)s. Prove
  that the set \(\{y_n\}_{n\in\bbN}\cup\{y\}\) is closed. Give a clear
  explanation. Do not use a metric.
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}
  Let \(X\) be a connected space. Let \(\calU\) be an open covering of
  \(X\) and let \(U\) be a nonempty set in \(\calU\). Say that a set \(V\)
  in \(\calU\) is \emph{reachable from \(U\)} if there is a sequence
  \[
    U=U_1,U_2,\dotsc,U_n=V
  \]
  of sets in \(\calU\) such that \(U_i\cap U_{i+1}\neq\emptyset\) for each
  \(i\) from \(1\) to \(n-1\). Prove that every nonempty \(V\) in \(\calU\)
  is reachable from \(U\).

  Let \(p\colon E\to B\) be a covering map. Suppose that points are closed
  in \(B\). Let \(A\subseteq E\) be compact. Prove that for every
  \(b\in B\) the set \(A\cap p^{-1}\{b\}\) is finite.
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}
  Let \(p\colon E\to B\) be a covering map. Let \(Y\) be a path-connected
  space and let \(y_0\) be a point in \(Y\). Let \(h,k\colon Y\to E\) be
  continuous functions with \(h(y_0)=k(y_0)\) and \(p\circ h=p\circ
  k\). Prove that \(h\) and \(k\) are the same function.
