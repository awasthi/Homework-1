\begin{problem}
  Let $X$ be a compact space and suppose there is a finite family of
  continuous functions $f_i\colon X\to\bbR$, $i=1,\ldots,n$, with the
  following property: given $x\neq y$ in $X$ there is an $i$ such that
  $f_i(x)\neq f_i(y)$. Prove that $X$ is homeomorphic to a subspace of
  $\bbR^n$.

\begin{problem}
  Let $X$ be any topological space and let $Y$ be a Hausdorff space. Let
  $f,g\colon X\to Y$ be continuous functions. Prove that the set
  $\left\{\,x\in X:f(x)=g(x)\,\right\}$ is closed.

\begin{problem}
  Let $X$ be the two-point set $\{0,1\}$ with the discrete topology. Let
  $Y$ be a countable product of copies of $X$; thus an element of $Y$ is a
  sequence of $0$s and $1$s.

  For each $n\geq 1$, let $y_n\in Y$ be the element
  $(1,\ldots,1,0,\ldots)$, with $n$ $1$s at the beginning and all other
  entries $0$. Let $y\in Y$ be the element with all $1$s. Prove that the
  set $\{y_n\}_{n\in\bbN}\cup\{y\}$ is closed. Give a clear explanation. Do
  not use a metric.

\begin{problem}
  Let $X$ be a connected space. Let $\calU$ be an open covering of $X$ and
  let $U$ be a nonempty set in $\calU$. Say that a set $V$ in $\calU$ is
  \emph{reachable from $U$} if there is a sequence
  \[
    U=U_1,U_2,\ldots,U_n=V
  \]
  of sets in $\calU$ such that $U_i\cap U_{i+1}\neq\emptyset$ for each $i$
  from $1$ to $n-1$. Prove that every nonempty $V$ in $\calU$ is reachable
  from $U$.

\begin{problem}
  Let $p\colon E\to B$ be a covering map. Suppose that points are closed in
  $B$. Let $A\subseteq E$ be compact. Prove that for every $b\in B$ the set
  $A\cap p^{-1}\{b\}$ is finite.

\begin{problem}
  Let $p\colon E\to B$ be a covering map. Let $Y$ be a path-connected space
  and let $y_0$ be a point in $Y$. Let $h,k\colon Y\to E$ be continuous
  functions with $h(y_0)=k(y_0)$ and $p\circ h=p\circ k$. Prove that $h$
  and $k$ are the same function.
