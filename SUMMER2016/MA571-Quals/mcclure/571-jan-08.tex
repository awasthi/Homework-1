\begin{problem}
  Let \(X\) be a topological space with a countable basis. Prove that every
  open cover of \(X\) has a countable subcover.
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
  Suppose \(\calB\) is a countable basis for \(X\). Let
  \(\{B_n:n\in\bbN\}\) be an enumeration of \(\calB\) and let
  \(\calU=\{U_\alpha:\alpha\in A\}\) an open cover of \(X\). To every
  \(B_n\) in \(\calB\) associate an element \(U_n\) such that
  \(B_n\subseteq U_n\) if such an \(n\) exists; otherwise, associate to
  \(B_n\) the empty set \(\emptyset\). We claim that the subcollection
  \(\calU'=\{U_n:n\in\bbN\}\) is a countable subcover of \(\calU\).

  The countability of \(\calU'\) follows from the countability of
  \(\calB\). Let \(f\colon\calB\to\calU\) be the function which assigns
  \(B_n\) to \(U_n\). Then, by definition, \(\calU'=f(\calB)\) and,
  restricting the codomain of \(f\) to \(\calU'\), we have
  \(f'\colon\calB\to\calU'\) is surjective. Since \(\calB\) is countable,
  there exists a surjection \(g\colon\bbN\to\calB\). Then, the map
  \(f'\circ g\colon\bbN\to\calU'\) is surjective. It follows that
  \(\calU'\) is at most countable.

  It remains to show that \(\calU'\) covers \(X\). Suppose \(x\notin U_n\)
  for any \(n\in\bbN\). Then, since \(\calU\) is a cover of \(X\), there
  exists an open set \(U_\alpha\in\calU\) such that \(x\in
  U_\alpha\). Moreover, since \(\calB\) is a basis for \(X\), and
  \(U_\alpha\) is open, there exists a basis element \(B_m\in\calB\)
  containing \(x\) contained in \(U_\alpha\). It follows that there is some
  nonempty open set \(U_m\) in the cover \(\calU\) containing \(B_m\) which
  implies that \(f(B_m)\neq\emptyset\). This contradicts the assumption
  that no \(x\notin U_n\) for any \(n\in\bbN\). Thus, \(\calU'\) covers
  \(X\).

  It follows that every cover \(\calU\) of \(X\) admits a finite subcover
  \(\calU'\) of \(\calU\).

\begin{problem}
  Let \(X\) be a compact space and suppose there is a finite family of
  continuous functions \(f_i\colon X\to\bbR\), \(i=1,\dotsc,n\), with the
  following property: given \(x\neq y\) in \(X\) there is an \(i\) such
  that \(f_i(x)\neq f_i(y)\). Prove that \(X\) is homeomorphic to a
  subspace of \(\bbR^n\).

\begin{problem}
  Let \(X\) be any topological space and let \(Y\) be a Hausdorff
  space. Let \(f,g\colon X\to Y\) be continuous functions. Prove that the
  set \(\left\{\,x\in X:f(x)=g(x)\,\right\}\) is closed.

\begin{solution}
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}
  Let \(X\) be the two-point set \(\{0,1\}\) with the discrete
  topology. Let \(Y\) be a countable product of copies of \(X\); thus an
  element of \(Y\) is a sequence of \(0\)s and \(1\)s.

  For each \(n\geq 1\), let \(y_n\in Y\) be the element
  \((1,\dotsc,1,0,\dotsc)\), with \(n\) \(1\)s at the beginning and all
  other entries \(0\). Let \(y\in Y\) be the element with all \(1\)s. Prove
  that the set \(\{y_n\}_{n\in\bbN}\cup\{y\}\) is closed. Give a clear
  explanation. Do not use a metric.
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}
  Let \(X\) be a connected space. Let \(\calU\) be an open covering of
  \(X\) and let \(U\) be a nonempty set in \(\calU\). Say that a set \(V\)
  in \(\calU\) is \emph{reachable from \(U\)} if there is a sequence
  \[
    U=U_1,U_2,\dotsc,U_n=V
  \]
  of sets in \(\calU\) such that \(U_i\cap U_{i+1}\neq\emptyset\) for each
  \(i\) from \(1\) to \(n-1\). Prove that every nonempty \(V\) in \(\calU\)
  is reachable from \(U\).

\begin{problem}
  Let \(p\colon E\to B\) be a covering map. Suppose that points are closed
  in \(B\). Let \(A\subseteq E\) be compact. Prove that for every
  \(b\in B\) the set \(A\cap p^{-1}\{b\}\) is finite.
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}
  Let \(p\colon E\to B\) be a covering map. Let \(Y\) be a path-connected
  space and let \(y_0\) be a point in \(Y\). Let \(h,k\colon Y\to E\) be
  continuous functions with \(h(y_0)=k(y_0)\) and \(p\circ h=p\circ
  k\). Prove that \(h\) and \(k\) are the same function.
