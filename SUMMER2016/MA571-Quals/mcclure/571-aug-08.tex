\begin{problem}
  Let \(X\) and \(Y\) be topological spaces and let \(f\colon X\to Y\) be a
  continuous function. Prove that
  \[
    f(\bar A)\subseteq\overline{f(A)}
  \]
  for all subsets \(A\) of \(X\).
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
  This is another characterization of continuity. Let \(x\in\bar A\). Then
  for every neighborhood \(U\) of \(x\), \(U\cap A\neq\emptyset\). In
  particular, if \(U\) is an neighborhood of \(f(x)\), \(f^{-1}(V)\)
  is a neighborhood of \(x\) so \(f^{-1}(V)\cap A\neq\emptyset\). Thus,
  \(V\cap f(A)\neq\emptyset\) so \(f(x)\in\overline{f(A)}\). It follows
  that \(f(\bar A)\subseteq\overline{f(A)}\).
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}
  Suppose that \(X\) is connected and every point of \(X\) has a
  path-connected open neighborhood. Prove that \(X\) is path-connected.
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
  Let \(x,y\in X\) and suppose there does not exists a path from \(x\) to
  \(y\). Hence, the sets
  \begin{align*}
    C&=\bigl\{\,y\in X:\text{there exists a path \(p\colon I\to X\)
       from \(x\) to \(y\)}\,\bigr\}\\
    D&=\bigl\{\,y\in X:\text{there does not exists a path \(p\colon I\to X\)
       from \(x\) to \(y\)}\,\bigr\}
  \end{align*}
  are nonempty. We claim that both \(C\) and \(D\) form a separation of
  \(X\). First we must show that these sets are open and that their union
  \(X\). The latter is immediate as every point in \(X\) is either
  connected to \(x\) by a path or it is not, i.e., \(C=X\setminus D\), and
  at least one of these sets is nonempty, namely, \(C\). To see that \(C\)
  is open let \(y\in C\). Then there exists a path-connected open
  neighborhood \(U\) of \(y\). If \(U\cap D\neq\emptyset\) and \(z\) is a
  point in that intersection, there exists a path \(q\colon I\to X\) from
  \(y\) to \(z\). But there exists a path \(p\colon I\to X\) from \(x\) to
  \(y\) so \(q*p\colon I\to Xs\) is a path from \(x\) to \(z\), which is a
  contradiction. Thus, \(U\subset C\) and \(C\) must be open. Consequently,
  a similar argument tells us that \(C\) is closed since if \(y\in\bar C\),
  \(U\cap C\neq\emptyset\) for every neighborhood of \(y\). In particular,
  for that special path-connected neighborhood \(U\) of \(y\), there is
  some \(z\in C\cap U\). If \(y\in D\), then there exist a path
  \(p\colon I\to X\) from \(x\) to \(y\), namely, the composite of the path
  from \(x\) to \(z\) and from \(z\) to \(y\). This yields a contradiction
  so \(y\in C\). Thus, \(C\) is closed so \(X\setminus D\) is open. It
  follows that \(C\) and \(D\) form a separation of \(X\). But \(X\) is
  connected
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}
  Let \(X\) be a topological space and let \(f,g\colon X\to[0,1]\) be a
  continuous function. Suppose that \(X\) is connected and \(f\) is
  onto. Prove that there must be a point \(x\in X\) with \(f(x)=g(x)\).

\begin{solution}
  Suppose
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}
  Let X be the two-point set \(\{0,1\}\) with the discrete topology. Let
  \(Y\) be a countable product of copies of \(X\); thus an element of \(Y\)
  is a sequence of \(0\)s and \(1\)s.  Let \(A\) be the subset of \(Y\)
  consisting of sequences with only a finite number of \(1\)s. Is A closed?
  Prove or disprove.

\begin{problem}
  Prove the Tube Lemma: given topological spaces \(X\) and \(Y\) with \(Y\)
  compact, a point \(x_0\in X\), and an open set \(N\) of \(X\times Y\)
  containing \(\{x_0\}\times Y\), prove that there is an open set \(W\) of
  \(X\) containing \(x_0\) with \(W\times Y\subseteq N\).

\begin{problem}
  Let \(X\) and \(Y\) be topological spaces and let \(f\colon X\to Y\) be a
  continuous function. Let \(x_0\in X\) and let \(y_0=f(x_0)\). Find an
  example in which \(f\) is onto but
  \(f_*\colon\pi_1(X,x_0)\to\pi_1(Y,y_0)\) is not onto. Prove that your
  example really has this property. You may use any fact from Munkres. Let
