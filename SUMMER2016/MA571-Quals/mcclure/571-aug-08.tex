\begin{problem}
  Let \(X\) and \(Y\) be topological spaces and let \(f\colon X\to Y\) be a
  continuous function. Prove that

\begin{problem}
  Let \(X\) be a topological space and let \(f,g\colon X\to[0,1]\) be a
  continuous function. Suppose that \(X\) is connected and \(f\) is
  onto. Prove that there must be a point \(x\in X\) with \(f(x)=g(x)\).

\begin{problem}
  Let X be the two-point set \(\{0,1\}\) with the discrete topology. Let
  \(Y\) be a countable product of copies of \(X\); thus an element of \(Y\)
  is a sequence of \(0\)s and \(1\)s.  Let \(A\) be the subset of \(Y\)
  consisting of sequences with only a finite number of \(1\)s. Is A closed?
  Prove or disprove.

  compact, a point \(x_0\in X\), and an open set \(N\) of \(X\times Y\)

\begin{problem}
  Let \(X\) and \(Y\) be topological spaces and let \(f\colon X\to Y\) be a
  continuous function. Let \(x_0\in X\) and let \(y_0=f(x_0)\). Find an
  example in which \(f\) is onto but
  \(f_*\colon\pi_1(X,x_0)\to\pi_1(Y,y_0)\) is not onto. Prove that your
  example really has this property. You may use any fact from Munkres. Let
