\section{MA 571 Fall 2015}
% \thispagestyle{empty}
This is material from the course MA 571 as it was taught in the fall of
2015.%
\bigskip
\subsection{Homework}
 Most of the homework is from \cite{munkres} with a few exercises
(especially those involving the quotient topology and manifolds) written by
McClure. Unless otherwise stated, whenever we quote a result, e.g., Theorem
1.1, it is understood to come from Munkre's \emph{Topology}.

Throughout these notes

\begin{tabular}{cl}
  $\bbR$ & is the set of real numbers\\
  $\bbC$ & is the set of complex numbers\\
  $\bbQ$ & is the set of rational numbers\\
  $\bbZ$ & is the set of the integers\\
  $\bbZ^+$ & is the set of positive integers, that is, $x\in\bbZ$ with
             $x\geq 0$\\
  $\bbN$ & is the set of the natural numbers $1,2,\ldots$\\
  $A\setminus B$ & is the set difference of $A$ and $B$, that is, the
                        complement of $A\cap B$ in $A$\\
  $X\approx Y$& means $X$ and $Y$ are homeomorphic\\
  $f\simeq g$& means $f$ is homotopic to $g$\\
  $X\simeq Y$&means $X$ and $Y$ are homotopy equivalent\\
  $G\cong H$& means $G$ and $H$ are isomorphic as groups
\end{tabular}
