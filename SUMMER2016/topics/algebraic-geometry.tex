\chapter{Algebraic Geometry}
We will talk about some algebraic geometry and then promptly move to linear
algebraic groups.

Here is the preliminary material
\section{Some Algebraic Geometry}
Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field and put $V\coloneqq k^n$. The
elements of the polynomial algebra $S=k[T_1,\dotsc,T_n]$ (abbreviated to
$k[\bfT]$) can be viewed as $k$-valued functions on $V$. We say that $v\in
V$ is a \emph{zero} of $f\in k[\bfT]$ if $f(v)=0$ and that $v$ is a zero of
an ideal $I$ of $S$ if $f(v)=0$ for all $f\in I$. We denote by $\calV(I)$
the set of zeros of the ideal $I$. If $X$ is any subset of $V$, let
$\calI(X)\subset s$ be the deal of the $f\in S$ with $f(v)=0$ for all $v\in
X$.

Recall that the \emph{radical} or nilradical $\sqrt{I}$ of the ideal $I$ is
the idal of the $f\in S$ with $f^n\in I$ for some integer $n\geq 1$. A
\emph{radical ideal} is one that coincides
