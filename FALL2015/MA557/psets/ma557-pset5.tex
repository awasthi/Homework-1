For $I$ an $R$-ideal consider the multiplicatively
closed set $S=1+I$. Show that
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep,label=(\alph*)]
\item $\widetilde S=R\setminus\bigcup\mathfrak{m}$, where the
  union is taken over all
  $\mathfrak{m}\in\Speck{\mathfrak{m}}(R)\cap V(I)$.
\item $\Speck{\mathfrak{m}}(R/I)$ are homeomorphic.

Show that the following are equivalent for a ring $R$:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep,label=(\alph*)]
\item there exist rings $R_1\neq 0$ and $R_2\neq 0$ so that
  $R\cong R_1\times R_2$;
\item there exist an idempotent $e\in R$ with $e\neq 0$ and
  $e\neq 1$;
\item $\Spec(R)$ is disconnected.

\begin{problem}
A topological space is called \emph{Noetherian} if the set of
closed sets satisfies the dcc. Show that if a ring $R$ is
Noetherian then so is $\Spec(R)$, but that the converse does not
hold.

\begin{problem}
A nonempty closed subset $V$ of a topological space is called
\emph{irreducible} if $V=V_1\cup V_2$, $V_1$ and $V_2$ closed
subset, implies $V_1=V$ or $V_2=V$.
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep,label=(\alph*)]
\item Show that in a Noetherian topological space every nonempty
  closed subset is a finite union of irreducible closed subsets.
\item Show that $V(\mathfrak{p})$, $\mathfrak{p}\in\Spec(R)$, are
  exactly the irreducible closed subsets of $\Spec(R)$.
