\begin{problem}
Let $R$ be a domain and $\Gamma$ the set of all principal ideals
in $R$. Show that $R$ is a unique factorization domain if and
only if $\Gamma$ satisfies the ascending chain condition and
every irreducible element of $R$ is prime.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
$\implies$ Suppose that $R$ is a UFD and let
$\mathfrak{a}_1\subset\mathfrak{a}_2\subset\cdots$ be an
ascending chain of ideals in $\Gamma$. Then
$\mathfrak{a}_1=\langle a_1\rangle$ for some $a_i\in R$ since
every ideal belonging to $\Gamma$ is principal. Now, since $R$ is
a UFD, $a_1$ factors uniquely (up to associates) as the finite
product $a_1=p_1\cdots p_k$ of (not necessarily distinct)
irreducible elements $p_1,...,p_k\in R$. If $a_1$ is irreducible
we are done (because in such a case $a_2\mid a_1$ if and only if
$a_2=ua_1$ where $u$ is a unit, hence
$\mathfrak{a}_1=\mathfrak{a}_2=\cdots$). Suppose $a_1$ is not
irreducible. Then since $a_2\mid a_1$, the irreducible factors of
$a_2$ consist of some (or all) of the irreducible factors of
$a_1$ (more precisely we can write $a_2=p_{\sigma(1)}\cdots
p_{\sigma(\ell)}$ for some injection
$\sigma\colon\{1,...,\ell\}\hookrightarrow\{1,...,k\}$ where
$\ell\leq k$). Inductively applying this argument to $a_n$ for
$n\geq 1$, we see that the process (of factoring $a_n$'s from
$a_1$) must terminate for some positive $r$ for otherwise we have
that
\[
a_1
=
a_2b_2=(a_3b_3)b_2
=
\cdots
=
(a_nb_n)b_{n-1}\cdots
b_2
=
\cdots,
\]
but every factorization of $a_1$ into irreducibles must have
length $k$. Thus, the ascending chain
$\mathfrak{a}_1\subset\mathfrak{a}_2\subset\cdots\subset\mathfrak{a}_r=\mathfrak{a}_{r+1}=\cdots$
is stationary for some positive integer $r$ and we say that
$\Gamma$ satisfies the acc.
\\\\
$\impliedby$ Conversely, suppose that $\Gamma$ satisfies the
acc. Let $a_1\in R$. If $a_1$ is irreducible we are done. Suppose
$a_1$ is reducible, then $a_1=a_2b_2$ for some non-units
$a_2,b_{11}\in R$. If both $a_2$ and $b_2$ are irreducible, we
are done. Without loss of generality we may assume $a_2$ is
reducible (as the argument to follow may be applied to the
$b_i$'s in case they are not irreducible). Then $a_2=a_3b_3$ (and
so $a_1=a_2b_2=(a_3b_3)b_2$) for some non-units $a_3,b_3\in
R$. Then we get the ascending chain of principal ideals
\[
\langle a_1\rangle\subset\langle a_2\rangle\subset\langle a_3\rangle\subset\cdots
\]
which must stabilize for some positive integer $r$ since $\Gamma$
satisfies the acc. This argument shows that there exits a
factorization of $a_1$ into irreducibles. We must now prove that
this factorization in unique (up to associates).

Suppose $a=p_1\cdots p_k=q_1\cdots q_\ell$ where
$p_1,...,p_k,q_1,...,q_\ell\in R$ are irreducibles.

Let $M$ be an Artinian $R$-module. Show that every injective
$R$-linear map $\phi\colon M\to M$ is an isomorphism.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
Suppose $\phi$ is not surjective. Then, there is some element
$x\in M$ that is not in the image of $\phi$. Now consider
cokernels $\coker(\phi^n)=M/\im(\phi^n)$

Let $M$ be a finitely generated Artinian module. Show that $M$ is
Noetherian.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
We shall induct on $n$ the number of generators of $M$.

Base case: Suppose that $M=Rx$. Then $M$ is cyclic and $M\cong
R/{\ann(x)}$ is an Artinian $R$-module, hence an Artinian
$R/{\ann(x)}$-module (if $N_0\supset N_2\supset\cdots$ is a
descending chain in $M$ as an $R/{\ann(x)}$-module, then it is a
descendig chain in $M$ as an $R$-model, hence is stationary for
nome $n$). Then $M$ is an Artinian ring. By (3.17) $M$ is
Noetherian hence, $M$ is Noetherian as an $R$-module.

Induction step: Assume that every Artinian module with a minimal
generating set of cardinality $\leq n$ is Noetherian. Let
$M=Rx_1+\cdots+Rx_{n+1}$. Then
\[
0
\longrightarrow
Rx_1
\hooklongrightarrow
M=Rx_1+\cdots+Rx_n
\twoheadlongrightarrow
M/Rx_1
\rightarrow
0
\]
is exact. Since $Rx_1$ is Noetherian and $M/Rx_1$ is Noetherian
(since its minimal generating set has cardinality $\leq n$), by
(3.5)  $M$ is Noetherian.
\end{proof}

Let $R$ be a ring that is Artinian or Noetherian, and $x\in
R$. Show that for some $n>0$, the image of $x$ in $R/(\ann x)^n$ is
a nonzero-divisor on that ring.

\begin{proof}
By 3.7 it is sufficient to prove this for $R$ Noetherian.
