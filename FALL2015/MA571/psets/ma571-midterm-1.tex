\begin{problem}
Let $A\subset X$ and $B\subset Y$. Show that the space $X\times Y$,
\[\clsr{A\times B}=\clsr A\times\clsr B.\]
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
Before we proceed, we need to prove the following nontrivial facts:
\begin{claim}[Munkres \S17, Ex.\,3]
If $A$ is closed in $X$ and $B$ is closed in $Y$, then $A\times
B$ is closed in $X\times Y$.
\end{claim}
\begin{proof}[Proof of claim]
\renewcommand\qedsymbol{$\clubsuit$}
We will show that the complement of $A\times B$ is open in
$X\times Y$. Let $(x,y)\in (X\times Y)\setminus(A\times B)$. Then
$x\notin A$ and $y\notin B$. Since $A$ and $B$ are closed in $X$
and $Y$, respectively, there exist neighborhoods $U$ and $V$ of
$x$ and $y$, respectively, such that $U\subset X\setminus A$ and
$V\subset Y\setminus B$. Then $U\times V\subset (X\times
Y)\setminus(A\times B)$ is a neighborhood of $(x,y)$ so, by Lemma
C, $(X\times Y)\setminus(A\times B)$ is open. Thus, $A\times B$
is closed.
\end{proof}
% \begin{claim}[Munkres \S17, Ex.\,6(a)]
% If $A\subset B$, then $\clsr A\subset\clsr B$.
% \end{claim}
% \begin{proof}[Proof of claim]
% \renewcommand\qedsymbol{$\clubsuit$}
% By Theorem 17.5(a), $x\in\clsr A$ if and only if for every
% neighborhood $U\ni x$, $U\cap A\neq\emptyset$. In particular,
% since $A\subset B$, $U\cap B\neq\emptyset$ for every neighborhood
% $U\ni x$ for every $x\in\clsr A$. Thus, $x\in\clsr B$ and we have
% the following containment $\clsr A\subset\clsr B$.
% \end{proof}

Since $A\subset\clsr A$ and $B\subset\clsr B$ then $A\times
B\subset\clsr A\times\clsr B$. Then by Lemma B
$\clsr{A\times B}\subset\clsr{\clsr{A}\times\clsr{B}}$, but by
Claim 1 $\clsr{\clsr{A}\times\clsr{B}}=\clsr A\times\clsr B$ so
$\clsr{A\times B}\subset\clsr A\times\clsr B$. To see the reverse
containment, take an element $(x,y)\in \clsr A\times\clsr B$ then
for $x\in\clsr A$ and $y\in\clsr B$. Thus, by Theorem 17.5(a) for
every neighborhood $U\ni x$ and $V\ni y$, we have $U\cap
A\neq\emptyset$ and $V\cap B\neq\emptyset$. Thus, $U\times V\cap
A\times B\neq\emptyset$ so by Theorem 17.5(b), since $U\times V$
is a basis element for the topology on $X\times Y$,
$(x,y)\in\clsr{A\times B}$. Thus, $\clsr{A\times B}\supset\clsr
A\times\clsr B$ and the equality $\clsr{A\times B}=\clsr
A\times\clsr B$ holds.
\end{proof}
\begin{problem}
Let $X$ be a topological space and let $A$ be a dense subset of
$X$. Let $Y$ be a Hausdorff space and let $g,h\colon X\to Y$ be
continuous functions which agree on $A$. Prove that $g=h$.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
Suppose, towards a contradiction, that $g\neq h$. Then $g(x)\neq
h(x)$ for some $x\in X\setminus A$. Since $Y$ is Hausdorff, there
exists neighborhoods $U\ni g(x)$ and $V\ni h(x)$ with $U\cap
V=\emptyset$. Since $g$ and $h$ are continuous, $g^{-1}(U)$ and
$h^{-1}(V)$ are neighborhoods of $x$. In particular,
$g^{-1}(U)\cap h^{-1}(U)$ is a nonempty neighborhood of
$x$. Since $\clsr A=X$, by Theorem 17.5(a), $\left(g^{-1}(U)\cap
h^{-1}(V)\right)\cap A\neq\emptyset$. Let $x_0\in\left(g^{-1}(U)\cap
h^{-1}(V)\right)\cap A$. Then $g(x_0)=h(x_0)\in U\cap V$. This
contradicts the fact that $U$ and $V$ were chosen to be
disjoint.
\end{proof}
\begin{problem}
Let $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces and let $f\colon X\to Y$
be a continuous function. Let $G_f$ (called the \emph{graph} of
$f$) be the subspace $\left\{\,x\times f(x)\;\middle|\;x\in
  X\,\right\}$ of $X\times Y$. Prove that if $Y$ is Hausdorff then
$G_f$ is closed.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
We will show that the complement of $G_f$ in $X\times Y$ is
open. Let $(x,y)\in(X\times Y)\setminus G_f$. Since $Y$ is
Hausdorff, choose neighborhoods $U$ and $V$ of $y$ and $f(x)$
respectively, such that $f^{-1}(U)\cap V=\emptyset$. Then
$f^{-1}(U)\times V\ni(x,y)$ is contained in the complement of
$G_f$ so, by Lemma C, $G_f$ is open.
\end{proof}
\begin{problem}
Let $X$ be a topological space and let $f,g\colon X\to\RR$ be
continuous. Define $h\colon X\to\RR$ by
\[
h(x)=\min\left\{(f(x),g(x)\right\}.
\]
Use the pasting lemma to prove that $h$ is continuous. (You will
not get full credit for any other method.)
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
Define the sets
\[
A=\left\{\,x\in X\;\middle|\;f(x)\leq g(x)\,\right\}
\quad\text{and}\quad
B=\left\{\,x\in X\;\middle|\;f(x)\geq g(x)\,\right\}.
\]
Note $X=A\cup B$ and $f(x)=g(x)$ for every $x\in A\cap
B$. Moreover, we have that
\[
h(x)
=\min\{f(x),g(x)\}
=\begin{cases}
f(x)&\text{if $x\in A$}\\
g(x)&\text{if $x\in B$}
\end{cases}.
\]
Thus, by the pasting lemma, $h$ is continuous if we can show that
$A$ and $B$ are closed in $X$.

We will prove that the complement of $A$ in $X$ is open; the
proof of $B$ is similar. Let $x\in X\setminus A$. Then
$f(x)>g(x)$. Thus we have the following result
\begin{lemma}
Let $x,y\in X$ with the order topology. Then there exists a
neighborhood $U\ni x$, $V\ni y$ with $U\cap V=\emptyset$ and
$x'<y'$ for all $x'\in U$, $y'\in V$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}[Proof of lemma]
\renewcommand\qedsymbol{$\clubsuit$}
We break the demonstration into the following cases:
\\\\
Case 1: Suppose there exists $z\in X$ with $x<z<y$, i.e.,
$z\in(x,y)$. Let $U$ be the ray $U=(-\infty,z)$ and $V$ be the
ray $V=(z,\infty)$. Then $U\cap V=\emptyset$ and for every $x'\in
V$, $y'\in U$ $x'<c<y'$, in particular, $x'<y'$.
\\\\
Case 2: Suppose that there does not exists $z\in X$ with $x<z<y$,
i.e., $(x,y)=\emptyset$. Let $U$ be the ray $U=(-\infty,x)$ and
$V$ be the ray $V=(y,\infty)$. Then $U\cap V=\emptyset$ and for
every $x'\in U$, $y'\in V$ we have $x'<x<y<y'$, in particular,
$x'<y'$.
\end{proof}

By Lemma 2, choose $U\ni g(x)$ and $V\ni f(x)$ as above. Then
$g^{-1}(U)\cap f^{-1}(V)$ is a neighborhood of $x$ with
$g(x)<f(x)$ for all. Hence $g^{-1}(U)\cap f^{-1}(V)\subset
X\setminus A$ and, by Lemma C, $X\setminus A$ is open. Thus, $A$
is closed.

Having satisfied the conditions of the pasting lemma, it follows
that $h$ is continuous.
\end{proof}
\begin{problem}
Let $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces and let $f\colon X\to Y$ be
a function with the property that
\[
f(\clsr A)\subset\clsr{f(A)}
\]
for all subsets $A$ of $X$. Prove that $f$ is continuous.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
Suppose that $f$ has the property given above then, we claim that
\begin{claim}[Munkres \S18, Theorem 18.1(3)]
For every closed set $B$ of $Y$, $f^{-1}(B)$ is closed in $X$.
\end{claim}
\begin{proof}[Proof of claim]
\renewcommand\qedsymbol{$\clubsuit$}
Let $B$ be closed in $Y$. Then we have $f(f^{-1}(B))\subset B$ so
if $x\in\clsr{f^{-1}(B)}$ then
\[
f(x)\in f(f^{-1}(B))\subset\clsr{f(f^{-1}(B))}\subset\clsr B=B,
\]
so that $x\in f^{-1}(B)$. Thus $\clsr f^{-1}(B)\subset f^{-1}(B)$
and $\clsr{f^{-1}(B)}=f^{-1}(B)$ as desired.
\end{proof}

the set

$\mathbf{0}$ there is a $U\in\mathcal{F}$ with $U\subset V$.

if there is no separation $X=U\cup V$ into disjoint open sets

are inseparable. Then $\sim$ is an equivalence relation (you
don't have to prove this). Now suppose that $X$ is locally
