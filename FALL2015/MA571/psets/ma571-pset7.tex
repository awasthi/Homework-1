\begin{problem}[Munkres \S26, Ex.\,8]
\begin{theorem*}
Let $f\colon X\to Y$; let $Y$ be compact Hausdorff. Then $f$ is
continuous if and only if the \emph{graph} of $f$,
\[
G_f=\left\{\,(x,f(x))\;\middle|\;x\in X\,\right\},
\]
is closed in $X\times Y$.
\end{theorem*}
[\emph{Hint:} If $G_f$ is closed and $V$ is a neighborhood of
$f(x_0)$, then the intersection of $G_f$ and $X\times(Y-V)$ is
closed. Apply Exercise 7.]
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
As we demonstrated in Problem 2.7 (Munkres \S18, Ex.\,17) $Y$ is
Hausdorff if and only if the diagonal,
$\Delta_Y=\left\{\,(y,y)\;\middle|\;y\in Y\,\right\}$, is a closed
subset of $Y\times Y$. Consider the map $F\colon X\times Y\to Y\times
Y$ defined by $(x,y)\mapsto (f(x),y)$. This map is continuous by
Theorem 18.4 as $f$ is, by assumption, continuous and $\id_Y$ is
continuous by 18.2(b) (since it is the inclusion $Y\hookrightarrow
Y$). Then
\begin{align*}
F^{-1}(\Delta_Y)
&=\left\{\,(x,y)\;\middle|\;\text{$F(x,y)\in\Delta_Y$, $x\in X$, $y\in
  Y$}\,\right\}\\
&=\left\{\,(x,y)\;\middle|\;\text{$(f(x),y)\in\Delta_Y$, $x\in X$,
  $y\in Y$}\,\right\}\\
&=\left\{\,(x,y)\;\middle|\;\text{$f(x)=y$, $x\in X$, $y\in Y$}\,\right\}\\
&=\left\{\,(x,f(x))\;\middle|\;\text{$x\in X$, $y\in Y$}\,\right\}\\
&=G_f
\end{align*}
is closed by Theorem 18.1(3).

Conversely, suppose $G_f$ is closed in $X\times Y$. Fix a point
$x_0\in X$ and let $V\subset Y$ be an arbitrary neighborhood of
$f(x_0)$. Then $Y-V$ is a closed subset of $Y$ so, by Problem 2.1
(Munkres \S17, Ex.\,3), the product $X\times (Y-V)$ is closed in
$Y\times Y$. In particular, by Theorem 17.1(2), the intersection
$B=G_f\cap X\times(Y-V)$ is closed in $X\times Y$. Thus, by Problem
6.5 (Munkres \S26, Ex.\,7), since $Y$ is a compact Hausdorff space,
the projection $\pi_1(B)$ onto $X$ is a closed subset of $X$. But
\begin{align*}
B
&=\left\{\,(x,y)\;\middle|\;\text{$(x,y)\in G_f$ and $(x,y)\in X\times
  (Y-V)$}\,\right\}\\
&=\left\{\,(x,y)\;\middle|\;\text{$y=f(x)$ and $(x,y)\in X\times
  (Y-V)$}\right\}\\
&=\left\{\,(x,f(x))\;\middle|\;f(x)\in Y-V\,\right\}
\end{align*}
so we have that $\pi_1(B)=f^{-1}(Y-V)=X-f^{-1}(V)$. One
containment is easy to see, namely ``$\subset$'': if $x\in B$ then
$x=\pi_1(x,f(x))$ for at least one $f(x)\in Y-V$. To see the reverse
inclusion, take $x\in f^{-1}(Y-V)$, then $f(x)\in Y-V$ so $(x,f(x))\in
B$, hence $x\in\pi_1(B)$. Thus, $X-\pi_1(B)=f^{-1}(V)$ is open
so $f$ is continuous.

\begin{problem}[Munkres \S26, Ex.\,9]
Generalize the tube lemma as follows:
\begin{theorem*}
Let $A$ and $B$ be subspaces of $X$ and $Y$, respectively; let
$N$ be an open set in $X\times Y$ containing $A\times B$. If $A$
and $B$ are compact, then there exist open sets $U$ and $V$ in
$X$ and $Y$, respectively, such that
\[A\times B\subset U\times V\subset N.\]
\end{theorem*}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
We first prove the theorem for the case in which $A=\{a\}$. Since
$a\times B$ is canonically homeomorphic to $B$, by Theorem 26.5,
$a\times B$ is compact. Therefore, for every covering by open
subsets $\left\{ U_\alpha \right\}$ of $a\times B$,
$U_\alpha\subset X\times Y$, there exists a finite subcollection,
say $\left\{ U_i \right\}_{i=1}^n$ covering $a\times B$.

% We first show the partially generalized lemma when $A=\{a\}$ is a
% single point. Since $a\times B\cong B$ is compact, we obtain $$a\times
% B\subset \bigcup(U_i\times V_i)$$ when $U_i\subset X$ and $V_i\subset
% Y$ are open, for finitely many indices $i$. We may assume each $U_i$
% is a neighborhood of $a$. We let $U=\bigcap U_i$ and $V=\bigcup V_i$
% and claim they satisfy the lemma presented; this is evident since
% $U\times V_i\subset U_i\times V_i\subset N$ for all $i$ hence $U\times
% V=\bigcup (U\times V_i)\subset N$, and also $a\times b\in a\times B$
% implies $b\in V_i$ for some $i$ so $a\times B\subset U\times V$.

% So by this partially generalized tube lemma, for each $a\in A$ let
% $U_a\subset X$ be a neighborhood of $a$ and $V_a\subset Y$ be open
% such that $U_a\times V_a\subset N$. Since $A$ is compact, we may
% choose a finite subset $\mathcal{A}\subset A$ such that $A\subset
% \bigcup_{\alpha \in\mathcal{A}}U_\alpha $. We let $U=\bigcup U_\alpha
% $ and $V=\bigcap V_\alpha $ and claim they satisfy the lemma
% presented. Since $U_\alpha \times V\subset U_\alpha \times V_\alpha
% \subset N$ we see $U\times V=\bigcup (U_\alpha \times V)\subset N$. As
% well, for each $\alpha \in\mathcal{A}$ we have $\alpha \times B\subset
% U_\alpha \times V_\alpha $ so that $B\subset V_\alpha $, implying
% $B\subset V$. And since the $U_\alpha $ cover $A$ by construction we
% have $A\times B\subset \bigcup (U_\alpha \times V)\subset U\times V$.
