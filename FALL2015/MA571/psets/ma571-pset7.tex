\begin{theorem*}
Let $f\colon X\to Y$; let $Y$ be compact Hausdorff. Then $f$ is
continuous if and only if the \emph{graph} of $f$,
\[
G_f=\left\{\,(x,f(x))\;\middle|\;x\in X\,\right\},
\]
is closed in $x\times Y$.
\end{theorem*}
[\emph{Hint:} If $G_f$ is closed and $V$ is a neighborhood of
$f(x_0)$, then the intersection of $G_f$ and $X\times(Y-V)$ is
closed. Apply Exercise 7.]

Let $A$ and $B$ be subspaces of $X$ and $Y$, respectively; let
$N$ be an open set in $X\times Y$ containing $A\times B$. If $A$
and $B$ are compact, then there exist open sets $U$ and $V$ in
$X$ and $Y$, respectively, such that
\[A\times B\subset U\times V\subset N.\]

nonempty.

\item[(b)] Show that if $A$ is compact, $d(x,A)=d(x,a)$ for some
  $a\in A$.

Let $X$ be a compact Hausdorff space; let $\left\{A_n\right\}$ be
a countable collection of closed sets of $X$. Show that if each
set $A_n$ has empty interior in $X$, then the union $\bigcup A_n$
has empty interior in $X$. [\emph{Hint:} Imitate the proof of
Theorem 27.7.]

This is a special case of the \emph{Baire category theorem},
which we shall study in Chapter 8.

Let $S^1$ denote the circle
\[
S^1=\left\{\,(x,y)\in\RR^2\;\middle|\;x^2+y^2=1\,\right\}
\]
and let $B^2$ denote the closed disk
