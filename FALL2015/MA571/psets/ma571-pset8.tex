\begin{problem}[Munkres \S 46, Ex.\,6]
Show that the compact-open topology, $\mathcal{C}(X,Y)$ is
Hausdorff if $Y$ is Hausdorff, and regular if $Y$ is
regular. [\emph{Hint:} If $\overline U\subset V$, then
$\overline{S(C,U)}\subset S(C,V)$.]
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
We will first prove the following fact:
\begin{lemma*}
If $C\subset X$ is finite, it is compact.
\end{lemma*}
\begin{proof}
\renewcommand\qedsymbol{$\clubsuit$}
Let $C\subset X$ be finite. Put $C=\{x_1,...,x_n\}$ and let
$\left\{U_\alpha\right\}$ be an open cover of $C$. Suppose that there is no
finite subcollection of $\left\{U_\alpha\right\}$ which covers $C$. Then,
for every $U_\alpha$ there is a distinct point $x\in C\cap U_\alpha$. This
contradicts the fact that $C$ is finite.
\end{proof}
Now, suppose $Y$ is Hausdorff. Let $f,g\in\mathcal{C}(X,Y)$ with $f\neq g$,
i.e., there exists a point $x_0\in X$ such that $f(x_0)\neq g(x_0)$. Since
$Y$ is Hausdorff, there exists disjoint neighborhoods $U$ and $V$ of
$f(x_0)$ and $g(x_0)$, respectively. Let $U'=S(\{x_0\},U)$ and
$V'=S(\{x_0\},V)$; note that $\{x_0\}$ is compact by the lemma and $U'$ and
$V'$ are subbasis elements of the compact-open topology by the definition
on Munkres \S 46, p.\,285. Then $U'\cap V'=\emptyset$ for otherwise, there
is a function $h\in U'\cap V'$ such that $h(x_0)\in U\cap V$, but this
contradicts $U\cap V=\emptyset$. Thus, $\mathcal{C}(X,Y)$ is Hausdorff.

Now, suppose $Y$ is regular. We will proceed by the hint. Let $U$ and $V$
be disjoint
\end{proof}

Show that if $Y$ is locally compact Hausdorff, then composition
of maps
\[\mathcal{C}(X,Y)\times\mathcal{C}(Y,Z)\longrightarrow\mathcal{C}(X,Z)\]
is continuous, provided the compact-open topology is used
throughout. [\emph{Hint:} If $g\circ f\in S(C,U)$, find $V$ such
that $f(C)\subset V$ and $g\bigl(\overline{V}\bigr)\subset U$.]

\begin{problem}[Munkres \S 46, Ex.\,8]
Let $\mathcal{C}'(X,Y)$ denote the set $\mathcal{C}(X,Y)$ in some
topology $\mathcal{T}$. Show that if the evaluation map
\[
e\colon X\times\mathcal{C}'(X,Y)\longrightarrow Y
\]
is continuous, then $\mathcal{T}$ contains the compact-open
topology. [\emph{Hint:} The induced map
$E\colon\mathcal{C}'(X,Y)\to\mathcal{C}(X,Y)$ is continuous.]

\begin{problem}[(A)]
\begin{definition}
Definition. If $X$ is a locally compact Hausdorff space then the
space $Y$ given by Theorem 29.1 is called the \emph{one-point
  compactification} of $X$.
\end{definition}

Let $X$ be a compact Hausdorff space and let $W$ be an open
subset of $X$ (so $W$ is locally compact by Corollary 29.3) with
$W\neq X$. Prove that the one-point compactification of $W$ is
homeomorphic to the quotient space $X/(X-W)$.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
\end{proof}
\newpage
\begin{problem}[(B)]
Let $X$ be a compact Hausdorff space, let $Y$ be a topological
space, and let $p\colon X\to Y$ be a closed surjective continuous
map. Prove that $Y$ is Hausdorff. [\emph{Hint:} one ingredient in the
proof is p. 171 \# 5.]

Note: combining this with HW 4 Problem E and HW 6 Problem A gives
a necessary and sufficient condition for a quotient of a compact
Hausdorff space to be Hausdorff.
