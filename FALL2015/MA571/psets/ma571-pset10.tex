\begin{problem}[Munkres \S52, Ex.\,2]
Let $\alpha$ be a path in $X$ from $x_0$ to $x_1$; let $\beta$ be
a path in $X$ from $x_1$ to $x_2$. Show that if
$\gamma=\alpha*\beta$, then $\hat\gamma=\hat\beta\circ\hat\alpha$.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
By Theorem 52.1, the paths $\alpha$ and $\beta$ induce a group homomorphism
$\hat\alpha\colon\pi_1(X,x_0)\to\pi_1(X,x_1)$ and
$\hat\beta\colon\pi_1(X,x_1)\to\pi_1(X,x_2)$, respectively. We want to
show therefore that the induced homomorphism
$\hat\gamma=\widehat{\alpha*\beta}$ is in fact equivalent to the
composition $\hat\beta\circ\hat\alpha$. Let $[f]$ be a loop based at $x_0$
then
\begin{align*}
\hat\gamma([f])&=\widehat{\alpha*\beta}([f])\\
               &=\bigl[\,\overline{\alpha*\beta}\,\bigr]*[f]*[\alpha*\beta]\\
               &=\bigl[\bar\beta*\bar\alpha\bigr]*[f]*[\alpha]*[\beta]\\
\shortintertext{by the well-definedness of the path product operation, we have}
               &=[\bar\beta]*[\bar\alpha]*[f]*[\alpha]*[\beta]\\
\shortintertext{by associativity of the path product,}
               &=[\bar\beta]*([\bar\alpha]*[f]*[\alpha])*[\beta]\\
               &=[\bar\beta]*\hat\alpha([f])*[\beta]\\
\shortintertext{where $\alpha([f])$ is a loop based at $x_1$ so}
               &=\hat\beta\left(\hat\alpha([f])\right)\\
               &=\bigl(\hat\beta\circ\hat\alpha\bigr)([f]).
\end{align*}
Thus, the following diagram commutes

\begin{problem}[Munkres \S52, Ex.\,3]
Let $x_0$ and $x_1$ be points of the path-connected space
$X$. Show that $\pi_1(X,x_0)$ is Abelian if and only if for every
pair $\alpha$ and $\beta$ of paths from $x_0$ to $x_1$, we have
$\hat\alpha=\hat\beta$.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
$\implies$ Suppose that $\pi_1(X,x_0)$ is Abelian. Then for any class of
loops about $x_0$, say $[f]$ and $[g]$, the product $[f]*[g]=[g]*[f]$. Let
$\alpha$ and $\beta$ be paths from $x_0$ to $x_1$. Then the induced map on
fundamental groups $\hat\alpha$ and $\hat\beta$ yield isomorphism by
Theorem 52.1 so that the map $\hat{\bar\beta}\circ\hat\alpha$ is an
automorphism of $\pi_1(X,x_0)$. Moreover, we have
\begin{align*}
\hat{\bar{\beta}}\circ\hat\alpha([f])
&=
\hat{\bar{\beta}}\bigl(\hat\alpha([f])\bigr)\\
&=
\hat{\bar{\beta}}\bigl([\bar\alpha]*[f]*[\alpha]\bigr)\\
&=
[\beta]*\bigl([\bar\alpha]*[f]*[\alpha]\bigr)*[\bar\beta]\\
\shortintertext{by associativity of the path product, we may rewrite the
  above expression as}
&=([\beta]*[\bar\alpha])*[f]*([\alpha]*[\bar\beta])
\shortintertext{noting that $[\beta]*[\bar\alpha]$ and
  $[\alpha]*[\bar\beta]$ are loops based at $x_0$, since $\pi_1(X,x_0)$ is
  Abelian, we have}
&=([\beta]*[\bar\alpha])*([\alpha]*[\bar\beta])*[f]\\
&=[e_{x_0}]*[f]\\
&=[f].
\end{align*}
Thus, $\hat{\bar{\beta}}\circ\hat\alpha=\id_{\pi_1(X,x_0)}$, i.e.,
$\hat\alpha=\hat\beta$.

$\impliedby$ Let $f$ and $g$ be loops about $x_0$. Then, since $X$ is path
connected, we claim that $f$ and $g$ are homotopic to the path product
$\alpha_1*\bar\beta_1$ and $\alpha_2*\bar\beta_2$ where $\alpha_i,\beta_i$
are paths from $x_0$ to $x_1$. More precisely, split $f$ into the paths
$f_1=f(t/2)$ and $f_2=f((t+1)/2)$; it is clear that $f=f_1*f_2$. Let
$x_2\coloneqq f_1(1)$ then there exists a path $\alpha$ from $x_2$ to $x_1$
since $X$ is path connected. Now we claim that the following
\[
H(x,t)\coloneqq f_1(x)*\alpha(tx)*\bar\alpha((1-t)x)*f_2(x)
\]
is a homotopy from $f=f_1*f_2$ to the extended loop $\tilde
f=f_1*\alpha*\bar\alpha*f_2$.
\begin{proof}[Proof of claim]
\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{$\clubsuit$}
It is clear that $H$ is continuous since it is
a path products and multiplication on the unit interval $I$ is
continuous so $tx$ is continuous. Lastly,
$H(x,0)=f_1(x)*\alpha(0)*\bar\alpha(0)*f_2(x)$ and
$H(x,1)=f_1(x)*\alpha(x)*\bar\alpha(x)*f_2(x)$.
\end{proof}
Now, let $f\simeq_p\alpha_1*\bar\beta_1$ and
$g\simeq_p\alpha_2*\bar\beta_2$ where $\alpha_i,\beta_i$ are
paths from $x_0$ to $x_1$. Then we have

\begin{align*}
[f]*[g]*[\bar f]*[\bar g]

\bigl[\overline{\alpha_2*\bar\beta_2}\bigr]\\
&=
[\alpha_1*\bar\beta_1]*[\alpha_2*\bar\beta_2]*
[\beta_1*\bar\alpha_1]*[\beta_2*\bar\alpha_2]\\
&=
[\alpha_1]*[\bar\beta_1]*[\alpha_2]*[\bar\beta_2]*
[\beta_1]*[\bar\alpha_1]*[\beta_2]*[\bar\alpha_2]\\
&=\hat{\bar{\alpha}}_1\bigl([\bar\beta_1]*[\alpha_2]*[\bar\beta_2]*[\beta_1]\bigr)*[\beta_2]*[\alpha_2]\\
&=\hat{\bar{\alpha}}_1\bigl(\hat\beta_2([\alpha_2]*[\bar\beta_2])\bigr)*[\beta_2]*[\bar\alpha_2]\\
&=[\alpha_2]*[\bar\beta_2]*[\beta_2]*[\bar\alpha_2]\\
&=[\alpha_2]*[e_{x_0}]*[\bar\alpha_2]\\
&=[\alpha_2]*[\bar\alpha_2]\\
&=[e_{x_0}].

Thus, $\pi_1(X,x_0)$ is Abelian.

Let $A\subset X$; suppose $r\colon X\to A$ is continuous map such
that $r(a)=a$ for each $a\in A$. (The map $r$ is called a
\emph{retraction} of $X$ onto $A$.) If $a_0\in A$, show that

Suppose $f$ is a loop in $A$ based at $a$. Then, extending the
codomain of $f$ to $X$, $f$ is a loop in $X$ based at $a$. Then,
since $r(a)=a$ for all $a$ and $f(I)\subset A$,
$r_*([f])=[p(f)]=[f]$ so $r_*$ is surjective.

Show that if $A$ is a retract of $B^2$, then every continuous map
$f\colon A\to A$ has a fixed point.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
Suppose that $A$ is a retract of $B^2$. Let $r\colon B^2\to A$ one such
retraction. If $f\colon A\to A$ is a continuous map, then $f\circ r$ is a
continuous map, by Theorem 18.2(c), from $B^2$ to $A$. Expanding the
codomain of $f$ to $B^2$, i.e., composing with the canonical injection
$\iota\colon A\hookrightarrow B^2$, we have a continuous mapping
$\tilde{f}\colon B^2\to B^2$ that coincides with $f$ in $A$. Then, by
Theorem 55.6, $\tilde f$ has a fixed point, i.e., $\tilde{f}(x)=x$ for some
$x\in B^2$. By the Brouwer fixed-point theorem for the disc, there exists a
point $x\in B^2$ such that $\tilde{f}(x)=x$, but $\im{\tilde{f}}=\im
f\subset A$ so $x\in A$. It follows that $f$ has a fixed point.

Prove that every $m$-manifold is locally path-connected.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
Suppose $M$ is an $m$-manifold. Let $x\in M$ and $U'$ be an arbitrary
neighborhood of $x$. Then, since $M$ is a manifold, there exists an open
neighborhood $U$ of $x$ that is homeomorphic to an open subset, say $V$, of
$\RR^m$. Let $h\colon U\to V$ be a homeomorphism. Then $h(U\cap U')$ is
open in $U$ so by Theorem 16.2, $h(U\cap U')$ is open in
$\RR^m$. Therefore, for sufficiently small values of $\delta>0$, we have
the inclusion $B(h(x),\delta)\subset h(U\cap U')$. We claim that
$W\coloneqq h^{-1}(B(h(x),\delta))$ is a path-connected neighborhood of $x$
contained in $U'$.

Containment is clear for $h$ is a bijection and we have that $W\subset
U\cap U'\subset U'$. By Example 3 in Munkres \S24 we know that open balls
in $\RR^m$ are path-connected therefore given $y_0=h(x_0),y_1=h(x_1)\in
h(W)$, there exists a path $p\colon I\to h(W)$ with $p(0)=y_0$ and
$p(1)=y_1$. Then $q\coloneqq \left(\bigl.(h^{-1})\bigr|_{h(W)}\circ
  p\right)\colon I\to W$ is a path in $W$ from $x_0$ to $x_1$. It is clear
that $q$ is continuous by Theorem 18.2(c) since it is a composition of
continuous functions (where $\bigl.(h^{-1})\bigr|_{h(W)}$ is continuous by
Theorem 18.2(d) since it is the restriction of a continuous
function). Lastly, $q(0)=x_0$ and $q(1)=x_1$. Since $x_0$ and $x_1$ were
arbitrary, it follows that $W$ is path-connected. Therefore, $M$ is locally
path-connected.
\end{proof}

Prove that every $m$-manifold is regular.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
Let $x\in M$ and $U'$ be an arbitrary
neighborhood of $x$. Then, since $M$ is a manifold, there exists an open
neighborhood $U$ of $x$ that is homeomorphic to an open subset, say $V$, of
$\RR^m$. Let $h\colon U\to V$ be a homeomorphism. Then $h(U\cap U')$ is
open in $U$ so by Theorem 16.2, $h(U\cap U')$ is open in
$\RR^m$. Since $\RR^m$ is regular, by Lemma 31.1(a), there exist an
neighborhood $W$ of $h(x)$ such that $\overline W\subset h(U\cap U')$. We
claim that $h^{-1}(W)\subset U'$ is a neighborhood of $x$ such
that $\overline{h^{-1}(W)}\subset U'$.

That $h^{-1}(W)$ is contained in $U'$ is clear since $h$ is a
homeomorphism and $W$ is contained in the image of $U\cap U'$. It is also
easy to see that $h^{-1}(\overline{W})\subset U'$ since, again $h$ is a
homeomorphism and $\overline W\subset U\cap U'$. Now, since $h$ is a
homeomorphism it is a closed map so $h^{-1}(\overline W)$ is a closed
subset of $U$ containing $h^{-1}(W)$. Therefore, by Lemma B,
$\overline{h^{-1}(W)}\subset h^{-1}(\overline{W})\subset U'$. Thus, by
Lemma 31.1, $M$ is regular.

\begin{problem}[(C)]
Prove that there is no $1$-$1$ continuous function $\iota\colon
S^1\to\RR$. You may assume any fact about trigonometric
functions. (Note: this shows in particular that there is no
$\iota\colon S^1\to\RR$ with $p\circ\iota$ equal to the identity
map, where $p$ is the map in the note on the Fundamental Group of
the Circle.)
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
Seeking a contradiction, suppose that $\iota\colon S^1\to\RR$ is a
continuous injection. Then $\iota$ cannot be a surjection since Theorem
26.6 would imply $S^1\approx\RR$, but $S^1$ is compact whereas $\RR$ is
not, contradicting Theorem 26.5. Therefore, by homework Problem 2.8
(Munkres \S18, Ex.\,4) $\iota$ is an imbedding of $S^1$ into $\RR$ and
$\im\iota=[a,b]$ for some $a,b\in\RR$ with $a<b$, since $S^1$ is compact
and connected. Define $\tilde{\iota}=\left.\iota\right|_{[a,b]}$ then
$\tilde\iota$ is a homeomorphism (it is continuous by Theorem 18.2(e),
and bijective since $[a,b]$ is the image of $S^1$ under $\iota$ so is a
homeomorphism by Theorem 26.6 since $S^1$ is compact and $[a,b]$ is
Hausdorff). Now, take the point $x\coloneqq (a+b)/2$ in the interval
$[a,b]$. By Lemma $A$, $S^1\smallsetminus\tilde\iota^{-1}(x)$ and
$[a,b]\smallsetminus x$ are homeomorphic. But $[a,b]\smallsetminus x$ is
disconnected, in particular $[a,x),(x,b]$ are open and closed and
$[a,x)\cup(x,b]=[a,b]\setminus x$ hence, form a disconnection, but
$S^1\smallsetminus\tilde\iota(x)$ is (path) connected: Let
$(x_0,y_0)\in S^1$. We rotate the circle $S^1$ so that
$(x_0,y_0)$ gets moved to the point $(1,0)$ clockwise via the the map from
$\RR^2\to\RR^2$
\[
R_\theta(x,y)=
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos\theta&\sin\theta\\
-\sin\theta&\cos\theta
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
x\\y
\end{bmatrix}
\qquad\text{where $\theta=\arctan(y_0/x_0)$}.
\]
Note that
\begin{align*}
R_\theta(x_0,y_0)
&=\left(\cos\theta x_0+\sin\theta y_0,-\sin\theta x_0+\cos\theta
  y_0\right)\\
&=\left(\frac{x_0^2}{\sqrt{x_0^2+y_0^2}}+\frac{y_0^2}{\sqrt{x_0^2+y_0^2}}
  ,-\frac{x_0y_0}{\sqrt{x_0^2+y_0^2}}+\frac{x_0y_0}{\sqrt{x_0^2+y_0^2}}\right)\\
&=(1,0)
\end{align*}
The map is continuous since multiplication is continuous by Theorem
21.5 and since $R_\theta$ is bijective (in particular, the matrix
$\left[\begin{smallmatrix}\cos\theta&\sin\theta\\-\sin\theta&\cos\theta\end{smallmatrix}\right]$
has determinant equal to $1$ so is invertible), $R_\theta$ is a
homeomorphism by Theorem 26.6 so by Lemma A, its restriction to $S^1$ is a
homeomorphism onto its image $R_\theta(S^1)$. Without loss of generality,
we may assume that $\iota^{-1}(x)=(1,0)$. Take any $(x_1,y_1),(x_2,y_2)\in
S^1\smallsetminus(0,1)$. Let $\phi_1=\arctan(y_1/x_1)/2\pi$ and
$\phi_2=\arctan(y_2/x_2)/2\pi$. Then the map $p(t)=(\cos 2\pi q(t),\sin
2\pi q(t))$ where $q(t)=(1-t)\phi_1+t\phi_2$ (counterclockwise, avoiding
$(0,1)$) is a path from $(x_1,y_1)$ to $(x_2,y_2)$. Thus $S^1\smallsetminus
(0,1)$ is path connected so is connected (as demonstrated by Munkres in
p.\,155 although he does not actually assign the result to a corollary as
he should).

To recap, if $\iota$ is an injection of $S^1$ into $\RR$ Theorem 26.6 tells
us that $S^1\approx\iota(S^1)$. But we have just shown that the circle
$S^1$ minus a point is (path) connected whereas the closed interval $[a,b]$
minus a point is not contradicting Lemma A. Therefore, no such imbedding
may exists for supposing so has led to a contradiction.
\end{proof}

Prove Proposition C from the note on the Fundamental Group of the Circle.

\begin{proof}
The statement of Proposition C is as follows:
\begin{proposition*}[\textbf{C}]
Let $A$ be a connected space and let $a\in A$. If two continuous functions
$\alpha,\beta\colon A\to\RR$ have the property that $\alpha(a)=\beta(a)$
and $p\circ\alpha=p\circ\beta$ (where $p(u)=(\cos 2\pi u,\sin 2\pi u)$)
then $\alpha=\beta$.
\end{proposition*}
We shall proceed by contradiction. Keeping $\alpha$ and $\beta$ as above,
suppose that $\alpha\neq\beta$.
