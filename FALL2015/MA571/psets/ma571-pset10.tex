\begin{problem}[Munkres \S52, Ex.\,2]
Let $\alpha$ be a path in $X$ from $x_0$ to $x_1$; let $\beta$ be
a path in $X$ from $x_1$ to $x_2$. Show that if
$\gamma=\alpha*\beta$, then $\hat\gamma=\hat\beta\circ\hat\alpha$.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
By Theorem 52.1, the paths $\alpha$ and $\beta$ induce a group homomorphism
$\hat\alpha\colon\pi_1(X,x_0)\to\pi_1(X,x_1)$ and
$\hat\beta\colon\pi_1(X,x_1)\to\pi_1(X,x_2)$, respectively. We want to
show therefore that the induced homomorphism
$\hat\gamma=\widehat{\alpha*\beta}$ is in fact equivalent to the
composition $\hat\beta\circ\hat\alpha$. Let $[f]$ be a loop based at $x_0$
then
\begin{align*}
\hat\gamma([f])&=\widehat{\alpha*\beta}([f])\\
               &=\bigl[\,\overline{\alpha*\beta}\,\bigr]*[f]*[\alpha*\beta]\\
               &=\bigl[\bar\beta*\bar\alpha\bigr]*[f]*[\alpha]*[\beta]\\
\shortintertext{by the well-definedness of the path product operation, we have}
               &=[\bar\beta]*[\bar\alpha]*[f]*[\alpha]*[\beta]\\
\shortintertext{by associativity of the path product,}
               &=[\bar\beta]*([\bar\alpha]*[f]*[\alpha])*[\beta]\\
               &=[\bar\beta]*\hat\alpha([f])*[\beta]\\
\shortintertext{where $\alpha([f])$ is a loop based at $x_1$ so}
               &=\hat\beta\left(\hat\alpha([f])\right)\\
               &=\bigl(\hat\beta\circ\hat\alpha\bigr)([f]).
\end{align*}
Thus, the following diagram commutes

\begin{problem}[Munkres \S52, Ex.\,3]
Let $x_0$ and $x_1$ be points of the path-connected space
$X$. Show that $\pi_1(X,x_0)$ is Abelian if and only if for every
pair $\alpha$ and $\beta$ of paths from $x_0$ to $x_1$, we have
$\hat\alpha=\hat\beta$.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
$\implies$ Suppose that $\pi_1(X,x_0)$ is Abelian. Then for any class of
loops about $x_0$, say $[f]$ and $[g]$, the product $[f]*[g]=[g]*[f]$. Let
$\alpha$ and $\beta$ be paths from $x_0$ to $x_1$. Then the induced map on
fundamental groups $\hat\alpha$ and $\hat\beta$ yield isomorphism by
Theorem 52.1 so that the map $\hat{\bar\beta}\circ\hat\alpha$ is an
automorphism of $\pi_1(X,x_0)$. Moreover, we have
\begin{align*}
\hat{\bar{\beta}}\circ\hat\alpha([f])
&=
\hat{\bar{\beta}}\bigl(\hat\alpha([f])\bigr)\\
&=
\hat{\bar{\beta}}\bigl([\bar\alpha]*[f]*[\alpha]\bigr)\\
&=
[\beta]*\bigl([\bar\alpha]*[f]*[\alpha]\bigr)*[\bar\beta]\\
\shortintertext{by associativity of the path product, we may rewrite the
  above expression as}
&=([\beta]*[\bar\alpha])*[f]*([\alpha]*[\bar\beta])
\shortintertext{noting that $[\beta]*[\bar\alpha]$ and
  $[\alpha]*[\bar\beta]$ are loops based at $x_0$, since $\pi_1(X,x_0)$ is
  Abelian, we have}
&=([\beta]*[\bar\alpha])*([\alpha]*[\bar\beta])*[f]\\
&=[e_{x_0}]*[f]\\
&=[f].
\end{align*}
Thus, $\hat{\bar{\beta}}\circ\hat\alpha=\id_{\pi_1(X,x_0)}$, i.e.,
$\hat\alpha=\hat\beta$.

$\impliedby$ Let $f$ and $g$ be loops about $x_0$. Then, since $X$ is path
connected, we claim that $f$ and $g$ are homotopic to the path product
$\alpha_1*\bar\beta_1$ and $\alpha_2*\bar\beta_2$ where $\alpha_i,\beta_i$
are paths from $x_0$ to $x_1$. More precisely, split $f$ into the paths
$f_1=f(t/2)$ and $f_2=f((t+1)/2)$; it is clear that $f=f_1*f_2$. Let
$x_2\coloneqq f_1(1)$ then there exists a path $\alpha$ from $x_2$ to $x_1$
since $X$ is path connected. Now we claim that the following
\[
H(x,t)\coloneqq f_1(x)*\alpha(tx)*\bar\alpha(tx)*f_2(x)
\]
is a homotopy from $f=f_1*f_2$ to the extended loop $\tilde
f=f_1*\alpha*\bar\alpha*f_2$. It is clear that $H$ is continuous since it is
a path products and multiplication on the interval $I$, $tx$, is
continuous. Lastly, $H(x,0)=f_1(x)*\alpha(0)*\bar\alpha(0)*f_2()$

\emph{retraction} of $X$ onto $A$.) If $a_0\in A$, show that

\begin{problem}[Munkres \S53, Ex.\,6]
Show that if $X$ is path connected, the homomorphism induced by a
continuous map is independent of the base point, up to
isomorphisms of the groups involved. More precisely, let $h\colon
X\to Y$ be continuous, with $h(x_0)=y_0$ and $h(x_1)=y_1$. Let
$\alpha$ be a path in $X$ from $x_0$ to $x_1$, and let
$\beta=h\circ\alpha$. Show that
\[
\hat\beta\circ(h_{x_0})_*=(h_{x_1})\circ\hat\alpha.
