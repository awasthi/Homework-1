\begin{problem}[Munkres \S25, p.\,162, \#6]
A space $X$ is said to be \emph{weakly locally connected at $x$}
if for every neighborhood $U$ of $x$, there is a connected
subspace of $X$ contained in $U$ that contains a neighborhood of
$x$. Show that if $X$ is weakly locally connected at each of its
points, then $X$ is locally connected [\emph{Hint:} Show that
components of open sets are open.]
\end{problem}
